&ldquo;No hut shelters Comala from the rain.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A family</span> of travelling vagrants were overtaken
on the high road just leading out of
Keswick, on the Penrith side, by a gentleman
on horseback. He had observed the same
group begging during the entertainments of
the regatta which had concluded but the evening
before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ho! ho! my good woman,&rdquo; he said, as
he passed in a sling trot, &ldquo;I am glad to see
your boy has found his second leg!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>
<p>The woman, who appeared to be young, and
who would have been handsome, had not dirt
and impudence rendered her disgusting, looked
behind her, and perceived that a poor, sickly,
ragged child, apparently about five years old,
who followed her, tired of his crutches, which
pushed up his little shoulders almost out of
their sockets, had contrived to loosen the bandage
of his tied-up leg, and slip it down out
of the dirty linen bag, in which it usually
hung on the double, and from which it was not
always released, even at night, as so doing necessarily
incurred the further trouble of tying
it up again in the morning. She laid down
her bundle, and stood still with her arms
a-kimbo, till, with hesitating steps, and looks of
suppressed terror, her victim came up; then
glancing round, to ascertain that the gentleman
was out of sight, she seized the child, snatched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
both the crutches from his trembling hands,
and grasping them in one of hers, she began
to flog him without pity. He seemed used to
this, for he uttered no sound of complaint;
silent tears only rolled down his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ye villain!&rdquo; said she at last, with a strong
Cumberland accent, and gasping for breath,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s not the first time, is it? it&rsquo;s not the first
time I&rsquo;ve beat you within an inch of your life
for this. But I&rsquo;ll do for you this time: that I
will! You shan&rsquo;t be a burden to me any
longer, instead of a profit. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the
miserable looks of ye,&rdquo; she added, shaking
him almost to atoms as she wheeled him round,
&ldquo;that sometimes wrings a penny out of the
folk, I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; finished ye long ago.&rdquo; Then,
with her great foot, armed with an iron-rimmed
wooden shoe, she gave him a violent kick on
the offending leg, continuing thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
best break the shanks on ye at ance, ye whey-faced
urchin ye! and then ye&rsquo;ll tak te yeer
crutches without biddin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Finding, however, that though he had staggered
and fallen forward on both hands, he had
yet risen again, and still contrived to stand,
she once more lifted her foot, to repeat the kick
with increased force: for she was as much intoxicated
by drink as by rage, and really
seemed to intend to break the child&rsquo;s leg; but
her husband, a sort of travelling tinker, coming
up at the moment, and uttering a violent
curse, struck her a blow that, poised as she just
then was on one foot, brought her to the
ground.</p>

<p>During the scuffle which ensued, the poor
little sufferer, who had occasioned it all, crept
through the hedge of a field by the road side,
and hid himself under some bushes. But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
woman, soon after pursuing in search of him,
jumped the fence, and dropped among the very
brambles where he lay. She perceived him
instantly, and shook her clenched hand, which
so paralysed him, that he did not dare to
move, though she for some time delayed seizing
him. Finding that the inside of the hedge
was covered with clothes for bleaching, she
thought it best, the first thing she did, to secure
a good bundle of so desirable a booty,
and fling it over to her husband. She was just
in the act of so doing, when the owner of the
linen came into the field, and immediately set
up the halloo of &ldquo;Thieves! thieves!&rdquo; upon
which, dropping what she had collected, and
giving up all thoughts of carrying the child
with her, she made the best of her way, and
disappeared not only from the spot, but from
the neighbourhood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>About an hour after, when the poor boy,
pressed by hunger, crept from his hiding place,
a girl, who was left to watch the clothes, spying
him, cried out, &ldquo;Ha! you little spawn
e&mdash;the devil! did she leave you to bring her
the bundle?&rdquo; And so saying, she pursued and
beat him, till she drove him out of the field,
and into the adjoining garden of an old woman,
who was standing at the moment with a long
pole in her hand, endeavouring to beat down,
as well as her failing sight would permit, the
few remaining apples from the topmost branches
of her single apple-tree: the well laden lower
boughs of which had been robbed of their
goodly winter store but the preceding night.</p>

<p>On seeing a boy scramble through her hedge,
she concluded, of course, that his errand was
to possess himself of the said remaining apples,
and, accordingly, uttering a yell of exe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>cration,
she converted her fruit-pole into a
weapon defensive and offensive, and hobbling
towards the poor child, drove him from her
premises; over the boundary of which, long
after he had so far escaped, she continued to
address to him, at the very top of her voice,
every opprobrious epithet of which she was
mistress: her shrill tones the while collecting,
at the heels of the fugitive, hooting boys, and
barking curs innumerable. These, however,
did not follow him far; and when they returned
to their homes or their sports, he wandered
about for the rest of the day, avoiding
houses and people, and fearing that every one
he met would beat him.</p>

<p>At length, towards evening, he found himself
on the borders of the lake of Derwent,
and seeing a boat fastened close to the land, he
got into it; partly with the idea of hiding him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>self,
and partly with a vague recollection of
having often wished to be a sailor-boy, when begging
about with his mother in sea-port towns.
He rolled himself up in an old cloak which
lay under one of the benches, where, exhausted
by pain, hunger, and fatigue, he fell asleep.</p>

<p>Shortly after our poor wanderer had chosen
this refuge, in stepped Master Henry St.
Aubin, whose pleasure-boat it was, to take a
sail <i>alone</i>, contrary to reiterated commands,
and for no other reason, but because, for fear
of accidents, he had been desired never to go
without a servant. He pushed from the land,
and began to arrange his canvass. He put up
his main-sail, which filling immediately, bent
his little bark on one side, almost level with the
water, and made it fly across the lake in great
style. When, however, it got under shade of
the high mountains on the Borrowdale coast,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
the breeze slackened, and he determined to add
his mizen and jib; but what was his surprise,
when, on attempting to remove the old cloak
which lay near them, he discovered within its
folds the sleeping boy. Supposing him to be
a spy placed there to watch his movements,
and report his disobedience, he began to curse
and swear, kicked at him under the bench, and
ordered him to pack out of his boat instantly.
The poor child, but half awake, gazed all
round him, got up as well as his bruises would
permit, and was about to obey in silence; but,
when, he saw how far they were from land, he
hesitated; upon which Henry took up a rope&rsquo;s
end, and lashed at him in the manner that sailors
call starting, repeating at each stroke,
&ldquo;Jump, spy! jump!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Driven almost wild with the pain of the
blows, the child at last did jump; but, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
same moment, caught instinctively at the side
of the boat, to which he hung with both hands,
and so kept his head above water. Henry set
up a loud laugh, and rowed out, towing him
after him. Then, willing to make sport for
himself, by terrifying the beggar brat, he attempted
to push his fingers off the edge of the
boat, but they clung to it with all the tenacity
of self preservation; when the one hand was
forced for a moment from its hold, the grasp of
the other became but the more convulsively
strong; and when the second was assailed by
the united efforts of both of Henry&rsquo;s, the first
returned to its former position.</p>

<p>At length, tired of the jest himself, Master
St. Aubin turned into shallow water, leaped
ashore, and suffering the half-drowned child
to land as he might, bade him scamper, ere
he had well got footing. Then, intent on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
pursuing his sweet, because forbidden amusement,
he stepped back into his boat, which with
its white sails, contrasted with the dark woods
of the coast it glided silently beneath, soon became
as picturesque an object as though the
urchin that guided it had been the most noble
and adventurous of romantic heroes.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>
&mdash;&ldquo;And I tremble amid the night.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">About</span> the centre of the entrance of the vale of
Borrowdale, conspicuously situated, stands that
curious rock, called, by the native Cumbrians,
Borrowdale-stane. In form and position it is
much like a dismasted and stranded vessel, laying
on its keel and leaning a little to one side.
On the highest point of this rock, a station well
known to the lovers of the sublime, stood a lady
wrapped in a warm fur lined cloak. Her air,
however, was much too fashionable and modern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
to harmonize in any degree with the wild desolation
of the surrounding region, which, when
viewed from the elevated position she thus occupied,
as far as the eye could reach, resembled
a stormy ocean: its gigantic billows formed by
the congregated tops of mountains.</p>

<p>The evening was cold, approaching to frost;
and the sun, though still much above the natural
horizon, was just sinking from view behind the
lofty chain of western hills: his last rays lingered
a while on the most prominent parts of each
stupendous height, then, gradually retiring, left
point after point, which, like so many beacon
lights extinguished by an invisible hand, successively
disappeared, till all became shrouded alike
in cheerless gloom and volumes of mist rolling
down the sides of the mountains, a dense fog
settled in the valley like a white and waveless
lake.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>The lady on the rock appeared to deem it
time to return home, for, withdrawing her eyes
from the distant view, she cast them downward
in search of the path by which to descend; when,
amid the rocks and huge rough stones which
lay scattered beneath like the ruins of a former
world, she thought she saw something move,
though very slightly. She looked at it for a
time; it quitted not the spot where she first
descried it; yet, still it certainly did move! She
descended, approached, and beheld a poor little
boy, who seemed about five or six years old.
He was sitting on the ground; the wretched
rags, in which he was dressed, were dripping
with wet; his poor limbs, which were all bent
together, and drawn up close to his face, trembled
extremely, while his little hands, with their
long emaciated fingers, spread and hooked round
his knees, seemed endeavouring to hold them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
as though the violence of their motion was
becoming too much for his frame to bear.</p>

<p>The lady stood looking down on him for a
moment with mingled pity and surprise. He
was slowly rocking himself from side to side: it
was a movement quite expressive of despondency,
his chin rested on the backs of the hands which
held his knees, and his eyes wandered hopelessly
among the bare stones that lay around him,
while his head retained the same fixed position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little boy, look up!&rdquo; she said, taking one
of his cold wet hands in hers. He raised his
face; misery was depicted in every feature: his
teeth chattered excessively, and his poor eyes,
that swam in tears, were now lifted to hers with
an expression truly piteous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor child! come with me,&rdquo; she said. Something
like hope began to dawn on his forlorn
countenance; but she finished her sentence, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
what she intended for the most comforting manner,
by saying, &ldquo;and I will take you home to
your mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had not risen. He drew his hand from
hers, turned on his face on the ground with the
universal shudder of terror, and, clinging to the
rocks, cried, &ldquo;No! no! no!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She endeavoured to soothe him, and to untwist
his fingers from the fastenings, which, like
so many fibres of roots, they had found for themselves
among the crevices and broken fragments
of his flinty bed; but he hid his face against the
hard stone, and would not turn round. When
she succeeded at length in detaching one of his
hands, and was gently endeavouring to raise
him, his inward shudderings increased so visibly
that she became fearful of throwing him into
convulsions: she desisted therefore, and, feigning
to go away, removed a few paces; then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
stopped, and said, &ldquo;Well! I am going; but
won&rsquo;t you tell me your name?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Edmund,&rdquo; he sobbed out; without, however,
raising his head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Edmund,&rdquo; said the lady, in a kind
voice, &ldquo;good night!&rdquo; He turned, sat up,
looked at her, and then all round, as though
having had her near him, even for the last few
seconds, the thought of being left alone for the
night now struck upon his heart anew with fresh
desolation; then, resuming the attitude she had
first found him in, he began, as before, to rock
himself from side to side and weep. &ldquo;But
where do you mean to sleep tonight, Edmund?&rdquo;
said the lady; &ldquo;I am sure you must be cold
sitting on those hard stones with your clothes
so wet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; he said, looking up wistfully
again, &ldquo;very cold, and very hungry.&rdquo; Then,
hesitating a little, he suddenly stretched out his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
hand, and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you, if you will
hide me from every one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will! I will, my poor child!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
flying back to him, kindly stooping
over him, and, with some difficulty, assisting
him to rise; for he was so stiffened it seemed
scarcely possible to unbend his knees: nor did
there appear to be one spark of vital heat remaining
in the poor little creature! She drew a
part of her warm fur mantle close over him,
and endeavoured to soothe him and give him
confidence in her protection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And will you stay here with me, then?&rdquo; he
whispered softly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will take you to a much more comfortable
place,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;where there is a good
fire, and a nice dinner for Edmund.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And are you sure she won&rsquo;t find me there?&rdquo;
he said, still whispering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;She shall never hurt you, while you are
with me,&rdquo; the lady replied, &ldquo;whoever she may
be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I will go!&rdquo; said Edmund; and he
lifted his head and tried to smile through his
tears. The lady, still sharing with him her
warm cloak, now led him by the hand, while he
held hers fast in both of his, and walked, with
short uneven steps, so close to her, that she was
every moment in danger of treading on his
little bare feet; and thus did they arrive at
Lodore House, just as the first roll of the thunder
resounded along the desolate valley they had
so lately quitted.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>
&ldquo;Vases filled with liquid beams, hang in chains<br />
Of gold.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">&ldquo;A sumptuous banquet</span><br />
Spread, invites the taste.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> cheerful, well-aired, already lit up dwelling,
now entered by our wanderers of the valley,
formed a striking contrast to the dreary scene
they had just left. An excellent fire blazed in
the hall, bronzed figures held flaming lamps
aloft, and powdered, well-dressed, well-fed servants,
bustled to and fro, bearing, towards the
dining-room, dishes, which though covered,
tempted the palate by the various savoury odours<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
they sent forth. In short, every comfort, every
elegance, nay, every luxury, evidently abounded
beneath the roof of Lodore House.</p>

<p>It had indeed, some years since, been a mere
shooting lodge, situated in the midst of an extensive
property, on which, from its remoteness,
no family mansion had ever been built. Mrs.
Montgomery, however, its present possessor,
had, since her early widowhood, made additions
to the lodge in her own taste: and though on
her daughter&rsquo;s account she regularly visited
London during the fashionable season, at all
other times she chose to reside in this romantic
retirement. The lady, who had just entered,
leading poor Edmund by the hand, was Frances
Montgomery, the only child of Mrs. Montgomery.
As Frances, with her charge, crossed
the hall already described, they met Henry St.
Aubin, a nephew of Mrs. Montgomery&rsquo;s, a boy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
of about twelve years old. Frances called immediately
for the housekeeper, and desired her
own maid to bring some warm soup. While
her attention was thus engaged, master Henry
contrived to come up close to the poor little
stranger, and say to him in an under tone,
&ldquo;Take care, you sir, you don&rsquo;t dare to tell, or
I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rdquo; Frances feeling an additional pressure
of Edmund&rsquo;s hand, turned suddenly round, and
saw the frown still on Henry&rsquo;s face, with which
he had thought fit to strengthen his arguments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How can you look so cross, Henry?&rdquo; she
exclaimed; &ldquo;you actually frighten the poor
child!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pshaw!&rdquo; said Henry, and went laughing
into the drawing-room, where he attempted to
entertain, by ludicrous descriptions of the pretty
new pet Frances had found; while she proceeded
to the housekeeper&rsquo;s room, and there,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
before a comfortable fire, herself assisted, in
despite of the dinner-announcing voice of the
gong, the operations of the two women she had
summoned. They released the poor child from
the wet rags which hung about him, sending a
chill to his little heart; they put him up to the
neck in warm water; and cautiously gave him,
by a little at a time, some nourishing soup.
Frances then called for meat, pudding, and
every thing nice she could think of; and, lastly,
for a supply of her own night things. By all
these prompt exertions, the poor, naked, shivering,
starving Edmund, was soon dressed in a
long sleeved, high collared, full frilled sleeping
chemise; his limbs warmly clothed in a pair of
the housekeeper&rsquo;s worsted web stockings, which
served him at once for drawers and hose; a
large dressing-gown of Frances&rsquo;s folded about
him, and a pair of her dressing slippers on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
little feet; and, thus equipped, he was seated in
front of the fire, with all the other good things
which had been called for, placed on a table
before him.</p>

<p>It was with the greatest pleasure that Frances,
who stayed to help him herself, saw him venture,
thus encouraged, to eat some dinner; and
what with the refreshment, the cleanliness, the
glow of all the surrounding warmth on his
cheeks, and the comfortable white dress up
about his neck, he certainly appeared almost a
new creature; though, when he looked up, there
was still a wildness, the unsteady glance of fear
mingled with the appealing expression of his
eyes; and when he looked down, their long
black lashes, sweeping his hollow cheeks, might
well inspire the beholder with even a painful
degree of compassion; yet when, notwithstanding
his timidity, he smiled with gratitude and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
sense of present pleasure arising from bodily
comfort, Frances, at least, could not help thinking
him grown already quite a beauty; and
she ran to the dining-room door, and entreated
her mamma just to come out for a moment and
see what a fine child the poor boy was, now
that they had washed and dressed him.</p>

<p>Lord L., hearing her voice, begged permission
to follow, but was refused.</p>

<p>Frances&rsquo; absence had, in the meantime, banished
the smiles of Edmund, so that Mrs.
Montgomery, on entering the housekeeper&rsquo;s
room, exclaimed, with a laugh, patting her
daughter on the cheek, &ldquo;I cannot say much for
his beauty, my dear!&mdash;But that is no reason
why you should not save the life of the poor
child,&rdquo; she added; and, with the tenderness of
one accustomed to a mother&rsquo;s feelings, she
stroked his little head.   He smiled again, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
she continued, &ldquo;but he may be pretty when
he gets fat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And shall he stay here to get fat, mamma?&rdquo;
asked Frances eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To be sure, my dear,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Montgomery,
&ldquo;we will never turn the poor little
thing out of doors again, while it wants a
shelter.&rdquo; Frances was delighted; caught up
both her mother&rsquo;s hands and kissed them,
and then the forehead of her protegé: nor did
she leave him till he dropped asleep in a comfortable
bed, with her hand in his to give him
confidence.</p>

<p>Frances at length entered the dining-room,
just as the domestic party engaged round the
table were dispatching a third or fourth summons
for her; the second course having by this
time made its appearance. Lord L., who occupied
his usual seat beside her chair, began to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
question her about the adventure of the evening.
Compassion made her eloquent on the misery,
the cold, the hunger, the wretchedness of poor
Edmund; but when she came to his beauty, she
faltered and looked at her mother with a beseeching
expression.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montgomery laughed, and replied to
the look, &ldquo;Oh, yes! there was a sweetness when
he smiled, that made me begin to think he would
be pretty if he were fat; but now, the poor
child is all eyes and eyelashes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, mamma!&rdquo; said Frances, &ldquo;he has the
most beautiful mouth I ever saw in my life, and
such nice teeth!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has he, my dear?&rdquo; said Mrs. Montgomery,
with provoking indifference: for she happened
to be deep in a discussion on the nature of the
poor laws, with Mr. Jackson, the clergyman.</p>

<p>Master Henry, meanwhile, was greedily de<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>vouring
tart and cream, with his face close to
his plate, and his eyes levelled at the dish, in
great anxiety to be in time to claim the last
portion which now remained on it; but, in his
attempt to swallow what was before him, he
missed his aim, and was a moment too late,
though he thrust out his plate with both hands
just as he saw a servant coming round; but the
tart was dispatched to Lord L., to whom it had
been offered, and who, being too much occupied
to refuse it, had bowed. It lay before him a
few moments, and went away untouched. Henry,
vexed extremely, and desirous of revenge on
Frances for the disappointment occasioned him
by her lover, said, &ldquo;If you are talking of the
beggar brat, he is the image of a monkey! I
was quite afraid he would bite me as I passed
him in the hall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure, Henry,&rdquo; retorted Frances, &ldquo;he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
seemed more afraid of you, than you could be
of him: and, by the bye, you need not, I think,
have looked so cross at the poor child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cross!&rdquo; repeated Henry, &ldquo;I did not look
cross. What reason do you suppose I had to
look cross? I never saw the brat before in my
life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henry&rsquo;s speech was accompanied by that
hateful expression, which the eyes of an ill-disposed
child assume, when it knows it is uttering
falsehood!</p>

<p>&ldquo;Henry!&rdquo; said Mrs. Montgomery, with
some surprise; &ldquo;you need not look angry, much
less guilty. No one can suppose that you know
any thing of the poor boy. But leave the room,
sir: and remember you don&rsquo;t sit at table again,
till you know better how to conduct yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henry obeyed, but slowly and sulkily; trailing
one foot after the other, and determining to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
have revenge on the cause of his disgrace. He
offered no apology, and therefore was not taken
into favour again for the evening, though poor
Mrs. Montgomery, as she passed to her own
apartment, looked into that where he lay, and
said, with a sigh, &ldquo;Good night, and God bless
you, child!&rdquo;</p>

<p>To account, in some degree, for the unprepossessing
manners of Master Henry, we shall
introduce a few words respecting the young
gentleman&rsquo;s birth, and hitherto unfortunately
directed education.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">St. Aubin</span>, Henry&rsquo;s father, was a Frenchman,
and totally without religion. A flourish of
worldly honour, as long as no temptation had
arisen, had sustained for him even a showy
character. By this, a showy appearance, and
showy manners, he had, what is called, gained
the affections, that is, he had dazzled the fancy,
of Maria, the younger sister of Mrs. Mont<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>gomery.
Maria was a beautiful girl, and but
seventeen. Her sister, who was also her guardian,
for she was some years her senior, and
their parents were dead, disapproved of the
match, but in vain: Maria married St. Aubin,
and was miserable! The marriage being a
runaway affair, no settlements were entered
into, which circumstance St. Aubin imagined
would be in his favour; but, when he discovered
that the consent of the guardians not
having been obtained, gave them the power of
withholding Maria&rsquo;s fortune till she should be
of age, and of then settling it on herself and
her children, without suffering him to touch
one shilling, his brutality was such, that Mrs.
St. Aubin, before the birth of her child, for
she had but one, was broken-hearted.</p>

<p>She denied herself the consolation she might
have found in the sympathy of her sister, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
she wished to conceal from her the wretchedness
she had brought upon herself, by acting
contrary to her advice. She was, however,
shortly removed out of the reach of that sister&rsquo;s
penetration.</p>

<p>St. Aubin was deeply in debt when he married,
and things had been ever since becoming
worse and worse. He had always flattered himself
that the guardians would not use the full
power of which they spoke, and that by making
fair promises he should be able, when once
Maria was of age, to get the money, or the
greater part of it, into his own hands; he had
therefore laboured incessantly to put off the
payment of every demand to the day of his
wife&rsquo;s coming of age, and made all his arrangements
with reference to that period. At length
it arrived. He made application for his wife&rsquo;s
fortune; but Mrs. Montgomery, in reply, re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>minded
him, that her sister having married
without her consent, had given her, as sole remaining
guardian, a power, which she now saw
it was her duty to exert; namely, that of refusing
to pay down any part of the money.
She should, therefore, she said, secure the whole
of it in the hands of trustees, as a future provision
for Maria and her child.</p>

<p>With this letter open in his hand, St. Aubin,
foaming with rage, entered the room where his
wife sat with Henry, then between two and
three years old, playing on the ground at her
feet, while she was absorbed in melancholy anticipations
of the probable result of her husband&rsquo;s
application. St. Aubin flung the letter
in her face, swearing, with horrid imprecations,
that he would be the death both of her and her
brat, and then blow out his own brains. Mrs.
St. Aubin remained silent; but the shrieks of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
the child brought servants. By the time they
arrived, however, St. Aubin was striding up
and down the room, venting his rage on the
open letter, which he kicked before him at each
step.</p>

<p>Shortly after this final disappointment respecting
Maria&rsquo;s fortune, St. Aubin found it
necessary to take refuge from his creditors in
the Isle of Man; whither he went accordingly,
carrying with him his wife and child, and settling
there with a very reduced establishment.</p>

<p>Not choosing, it would seem, to be hung for
declared murder, he appeared determined, by
every species of ingenious barbarity, to torture
the wretched Maria out of her remaining shred
of existence; and, among other devices, he daily
and hourly made her shudder, by his vows of
deep and black revenge on her sister.</p>

<p>One day, after sitting some time leaning his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
head on his hand, with a countenance resembling
the thunder-cloud, lightning suddenly
flashed from his eyes, imprecations exploded
from his lips, he started to his feet, stood before
his wife, and clenching his hand, uttered
these words: &ldquo;I tell you, Mrs. St. Aubin, that
child, that I hate, because it is yours! that
child, to whose future provision she has sacrificed
me! that child I will rear, I will preserve,
for the sole purpose of being the instrument
of my revenge!&mdash;by his means, were it
twenty years hence, were it thirty years hence,
I will break her heart! Yes,&rdquo; he added, as if
in reply to a look from Maria of astonishment,
almost amounting to incredulity, &ldquo;and I have
determined how I shall do it.&rdquo; He then resumed
his sitting attitude, and again leaning his
head on his hand, a long hour of utter silence
followed, during which his unhappy wife sat at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
the other side of the table, not daring to arouse
him by rising to leave the room.</p>

<p>Henry, at this time, promised to have in him
a strange mixture of the dispositions both of
his father and mother; or, in other words, of
evil and good. The evil certainly did predominate;
yet, had a careful hand early separated
the seeds, cultivated the good, and cast out the
bad, this ill-fated child might have been saved
from perdition; or had he, with all his faults,
been supplied with that only unerring standard
of right, the practical application of sacred
truths to moral obligations, even in after-life
there might have been hope; but his father, as
we have said, had no religion: he daily scoffed
at whatever was most sacred, purposely to insult
the feelings of his wife, and this before his
child. One morning, he found Maria with the
Bible before her, and Henry on her knee. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
looked at them for a moment; then taking the
child by the shoulder, he raised one foot level
with the hand in which he held him, and kicked
him, in a contemptuous manner, as he swung
him to the middle of the floor, saying, that
such a mammy&rsquo;s brat ought to have been a
girl. Mrs. St. Aubin ran to raise the child
from the ground. St. Aubin snatched up the
sacred volume, open as it lay, and flung it after
her, telling her, in a voice of thunder, that she
was a psalm-singing fool, and ordering her not
to cram the boy&rsquo;s head with any of her cursed
nonsense. Indeed, in his calmest and best disposed
moods, &ldquo;You are a fool, Mrs. St.
Aubin!&rdquo; was his usual remark on any thing his
wife ventured to say or do.</p>

<p>Mrs. St. Aubin having ascertained that the
child was not hurt, took up the book, arranged
its ruffled leaves in silence, and laid it with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
reverence on the table. Her husband viewed
her with a malicious grin till her task was completed;
then, walking up to the table, he opened
the treasury of sacred knowledge, and deliberately
tore out every leaf, flinging them, now on
one side, now on the other, to each far corner
of the apartment; then striding towards the
fire-place, he planted himself on the hearth,
with his back to the chimney, his legs spread in
the attitude of a colossal statue, the tails of his
coat turned apart under his arms, and his hands
in his side-pockets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, looking at his wife, &ldquo;pick
them up!&mdash;pick them up! pick them up!&rdquo; he
continued, till all were collected.</p>

<p>Mrs. St. Aubin was about to place the sheets
within their vacant cover on the table; but,
with a stamp of his foot, which made every
article of furniture in the room shake, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
brought a picture that hung against the wall,
on its face to the floor, he commanded her to
put them in the fire. She hesitated; when
seizing her arm, he shook it over the flames,
till the paper taking fire, she was compelled to
loose her hold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ought to have reserved a sheet to have
made a fool&rsquo;s cap for you, I think,&rdquo; he said,
perceiving that silent tears were following each
other down the cheeks of his wife. &ldquo;Why,
what an idiot you are! the child has more
sense than you have,&rdquo; he added, seeing that
Henry, occupied by surprise and curiosity, was
not crying. &ldquo;Come, Henry,&rdquo; he continued, in
a voice for him most condescending, &ldquo;you shall
carry my fishing basket to-day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henry had been just going to pity his poor
mamma when he saw her crying; but hearing
his father say that he had more sense than his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
mother, he could not help feeling raised in his
own estimation, and anxious to show his sense
by flying with peculiar alacrity for the basket.</p>

<p>He had viewed the whole of the preceding
scene with but little comprehension, as may be
supposed, of its meaning, and with very confused
ideas of right and wrong, being, at the time,
not above six years old; but the practical
lesson&mdash;and there are no lessons like practical
lessons&mdash;made an indelible impression: all future
efforts, whether of mother or aunt, usher or
schoolmaster, layman or divine, to infuse into
Henry precepts derived from a source he had
seen so contemned by his father, were for ever
vain. His father, he was old enough to perceive,
was feared and obeyed by every one within the
small sphere of his observation: for him, therefore,
he felt a sort of spurious deference, though
he could not love him.   For his mother, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
had always indulged him with the too great
tenderness of a gentle spirit utterly broken, and
who had wept over him many a silent hour, till
his little heart was saddened without his knowing
why, he naturally felt some affection; but then
he daily saw her treated with indignity, and
therefore did not respect either her or her
lessons: for he was just at the age when a quick
child judges wrong, a dull one not at all.</p>

<p>Henry had much of the violence of his father&rsquo;s
temper, with some of the fearfulness of
his mother&rsquo;s. In judicious hands, the latter,
though no virtue, might have been made to
assist in correcting the former; the whole current
of his fears might have been turned into a
useful channel: in short, he might have been
taught to fear only doing wrong, and, by a strict
administration of justice, proving to him his
perfect security from blame while he did right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
he might have been given all that honest-hearted
boldness in a good cause, which, throughout
after-life, is so necessary to ensure dignity to
the character of man, and the early promises of
which, it is so delightful to see in the happy
open countenance, in the very step and air of a
fine frank boy, who has never had his spirit
broken by undeserved harshness, or been rendered
hopeless of pleasing by inconsistency.</p>

<p>Henry, on the contrary, when he had done
no real wrong, was frequently treated with the
most violent cruelty; while his very worst faults
passed unreproved, if they did not happen to
cross the whims of his father: and this cruelty,
thus inflicted on a helpless, powerless child,
which could not resist, for ever raised in the
breast of Henry, who was, as we have said, naturally
violent, an ever unsatisfied thirst of vengeance;
a sense too of the injustice of the pu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>nishments
inflicted, a thing early understood by
children, embittered his feelings, and the transient
impressions thus rendered permanent, corroded
inwardly, till they settled into a malice
of nature, totally subversive of all that was or
might have been good or amiable.</p>

<p>Alas! why will not parents reflect, how much
the characters and happiness of their children,
in after life, depend on the species of minor experience
collected in infancy, and the few years
immediately succeeding that period. When intellect
is matured, we may call upon it to judge
of great events, to guide us in great undertakings,
or lead us to signal self-conquests; but
by this time, the feelings, the strong holds,
whether of vice or virtue, are pre-occupied, and
the passions, already in arms and in the field,
too probably on the side of error, certainly so, if
hitherto undirected.   And hence it is, that in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
so many minds the kingdom within is found in a
perpetual state of rebellion against the sovereignty
of reason: or, in other words, hence it
is, that so many people daily act by impulse,
contrary to what they call their better judgment.
Here, then, is the true task of the parent; to
use, for the benefit of his child, that deliberate
sense of right, which, in his own case, comes frequently
too late for action. And how shall that
parent depart in peace, who has not thus endeavoured,
at least, to smooth the path of truth
before the footsteps of his child?</p>

<p>When Henry was old enough for public education,
Mrs. Montgomery wrote to her sister, to
offer an allowance for the expenses of placing
him at school. St. Aubin ordered his wife
to accept the offer, and selected S&mdash; B&mdash;
school, with the meanest description of lodging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
in the neighbouring village, as the cheapest he
could hear of, that a part of the allowance, which
was liberal, might remain in his own hands.</p>

<p>The school-house, at the period of which we
speak, could accommodate but a very few of the
boys, while the rest were generally lodged in the
houses of the poor villagers; where, it is to be
feared, they lorded it, and did just as they
pleased.</p>

<p>Rather more than a year before the opening
of this history, St. Aubin was assailed by a
temptation, against which, the fear of detection,
in the desperate state of his affairs, was an insufficient
defence. He yielded, and became
engaged in a swindling transaction to an immense
amount. The business was discovered,
and St. Aubin apprehended under circumstances
which left no doubt of his being hung,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
unless steps were taken to prevent the prosecution.
In this extremity the wretched Maria
entreated her sister, if the sacrifice of the fortune
so long preserved would suffice, to rescue
with it herself and child from the disgrace of
having a husband and father die an ignominious
death. A compromise was accordingly
offered, and accepted. It was not, however, in
the power of the persons principally interested,
to do more than connive at the escape of St.
Aubin, who therefore fled the kingdom, taking
with him his miserable wife, and his black factotum,
the only slaves utter beggary had left
him; and abandoning the child, still at S&mdash; B&mdash;
school, to the compassion of Mrs. Montgomery.
Nor did he remit any part of his hatred to that
lady, notwithstanding her late concession; on
the contrary, he called down fresh imprecations
on her head, as being the sole cause, he said, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
all his misfortunes, by having withheld the
money at the time it would have been really of
use, and enabled him to have arranged his
affairs before they became quite desperate.</p>

<p>The next accounts Mrs. Montgomery had of
her sister and St. Aubin were, that the ship in
which they had sailed, with all the crew, and
passengers, had perished off the coast of
France. The affair was of too public a nature
to afford, from the first, the slightest hope
of mis-statement; for the vessel, though a merchantman,
was of importance, from the value
of her cargo, as she had much specie on board.
The circumstances too under which she was
lost were remarkable, and consequently made
a great noise, for the weather was perfectly
calm. She had been seen and passed in the
evening by a frigate homeward bound, but
after that was never seen or heard of more, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
not even one individual, it was stated, had
escaped, to relate the particulars of the accident:
it was therefore concluded, that she must
have foundered during the night.</p>

<p>Thus was Henry cast entirely on Mrs. Montgomery;
who, while she grieved to trace in him
the evil nature of his father, could not help
loving him, as the child of her poor lost sister.
Having concluded this necessary retrospect, we
shall, in our next chapter, return to our narrative.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> left the family at Lodore House enjoying,
we hope, the refreshment of a good night&rsquo;s rest.
The next morning Frances, before she thought
of breakfast, repaired to the bedside of Edmund.
He had been for some time awake; but, unaccustomed,
it would seem, to have any friend or
confidant, he had not ventured to speak or stir.
The tones of Frances&rsquo; voice, naming him to the
servants as she inquired for him, appeared to
bring at once happiness and confidence to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
heart. He opened his eyes as she bent over
him: he started up, clung round her neck, and
wept; though now it was evidently for joy.
These first transports, over however, he cast,
from time to time, doubting glances on the various
sides of the apartment, and especially towards
that in which the door was placed, and
evinced a great anxiety to retain Frances&rsquo; hand.
She thought him feverish; and with great
alarm perceived that his poor little frame
was covered with fearful bruises. His neck
and hands first drew her attention; and Mrs.
Smyth, the housekeeper, soon ascertained that
the limbs, concealed by the night-dress, had
suffered full as much. Frances sent to Keswick
for medical aid, and left her charge with Mrs.
Smyth. Mrs. Smyth was a good-natured woman,
added to which, the patience and gentleness
of the little sufferer had begun to win upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
her heart, from the very moment her assistance
was first ordered to him. She found it necessary
to sit by and encourage him while he breakfasted,
for, like a wild animal, driven by hunger nearer
to the haunts of man than usual, he started, and
desisted from eating, at every sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what might you have for breakfast
yesterday&rsquo;s morn, my dear?&rdquo; said Mrs. Smyth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what had you for dinner, then?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, my dear!&rdquo; repeated the good
woman; &ldquo;and ye could na ha&rsquo; less! Ney fault
tell the cooking o&rsquo; sic dinners, to be sure! And
wha was it then, that beat and bruised the life
and saul out on ye in this shamefoo manner, my
dear?&rdquo; she continued.</p>

<p>Edmund trembled, sighed heavily, and was
silent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And win&rsquo;t ye tall me wha it was &rsquo;at beat
ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tears stood in his eyes, but still he was silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you win&rsquo;t speak till me! And after the
nice breakfast I geed ye, too!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tears now flowed, but still he was silent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And wha was it then, that droonded ye in
the water?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked all round, but did not speak; and
Mrs. Smyth soon saw it was vain to persist in
questioning him.</p>

<p>Mr. Dixon, the Keswick surgeon, arrived.
He inquired of Mrs. Smyth what the child
had eaten, and how his food had seemed to
agree with him. Having received due replies,
he turned to Frances, who by this time was just
entering, and addressed her thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should not have anticipated, madam&mdash;I
should not have anticipated, that so great a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
variety of aliment would have assimilated well in
the child&rsquo;s stomach; but, such being the case, I
never set my face against facts, madam!&mdash;never
set my face against facts! I should, therefore,
continue the course which has been hitherto
pursued, with respect to nutriment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; but have you seen his bruises?&rdquo;
asked Frances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My practice is very simple, madam,&rdquo; resumed
the doctor, without answering her question;
&ldquo;I love to go hand-in-hand with our
great instructress, Nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;these terrible bruises, sir! What is
your&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is too much the custom with men of our
profession, to oppose the efforts of nature; but
I love to assist them, madam&mdash;I love to assist
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are quite right, sir. But, do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
think those bruises will be of any consequence?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Depend upon it, madam, depend upon it,
there is always a revulsion, as it were, towards
right; a rebounding, a returning, in nature to
her usual functions, as first ordained by her all,
wise Creator; and our part, is carefully to watch
those movements. And when the elasticity of
any power is impaired by the forcible, or long
continued pressure of adventitious circumstances;
first, to remove the weight of such,
and then, by gentle stimulants, to restore buoyancy
to the injured spring; thus, madam&mdash;thus,
I ever doff my cap to Nature!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor having arrived at what seemed a
pause, at least, if not a conclusion, Frances had
some hopes of being heard; and, by way of exordium,
said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your system, sir, is as judicious as it is pious.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not presumptuous, madam!&rdquo; again
interrupted the doctor; &ldquo;I am not presumptuous&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I should like,&rdquo; persisted Frances, &ldquo;to
have the opinion of one so skilful, respecting the
bruises of this poor child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The doctor&rsquo;s ear at length caught the word.
&ldquo;The bruises, madam! the bruises! They have
been inflicted by a cruel and most unsparing
hand! No doubt of it, madam&mdash;no doubt of it!
Who was it that beat you in this shocking
manner, my little dear?&rdquo; he continued, stroking
the child&rsquo;s head good-naturedly.</p>

<p>Edmund looked alarmed, but made no attempt
at reply.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are, I hope, no inward bruises,&rdquo; resumed
the doctor: &ldquo;some of these outward
ones are attended with a degree of inflammation,
doubtless; but it is very slight and quite local,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and may, I hope, be even beneficial: inasmuch
as it may divert the attention of the system, and
prevent any more vital part becoming the seat of
disease; but it is not such as to require any
general reduction of a patient already so low.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am delighted to hear you say so, sir!&rdquo; exclaimed
Frances; &ldquo;for I wish so much to give
him every thing good, when I think, poor fellow,
that perhaps he never had a comfortable meal in
his life, before last night! And I long so, too,&rdquo;
she added, looking at Edmund, &ldquo;to see the little
creature quite fat and rosy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No roses here, madam! doubtless none,
nor rotundity of limb, that is most certain. I
do not know that I have ever met with a more
decided case of emaciation in the whole course
of my practice! Look at his fingers, madam!
do look at his fingers! Nor do I think that
his pulse would warrant me in bleeding him at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
present, as I should, doubtless, any other patient,
labouring under contusions of this nature.
I will, therefore, send an emolient and cooling
mixture, with which, Mrs. Smyth, you will
bathe the parts frequently. Nutriment and
quiet will do the rest,&rdquo; he added, turning again
to Frances, &ldquo;for his fever proceeds entirely
from irritation of the nervous system, not from
general fulness; therefore, as I said before,
cannot require general reduction. General opposed
to general, you see, madam, in the healing,
as well as in the wounding profession!
Heigh! heigh! You don&rsquo;t admire puns, I
know; but come, that&rsquo;s rather a good one, is
it not? Good morning to you.&rdquo; And so saying,
though on the wrong side of sixty, the
doctor performed an active pirouette at the
door, as was his custom; and, with the lightness
of a lad of sixteen, made good his retreat,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
being in great haste to leave the impression of
the last good thing he had said fresh on the
minds of his hearers. Notwithstanding these
little innocent peculiarities, Mr. Dixon was a
truly worthy, a kind-hearted, and a skilful
man, charitable to the poor, and solicitously
attentive to his patients; and, with all, he had
not a mercenary thought! Mrs. Montgomery
had employed him for many years; and such
was her confidence in his abilities, that she
would have judged those she regarded, less safe
in any other hands.</p>

<p>Frances flew after Mr. Dixon, to entreat his
aid for Fairy, her beautiful Italian greyhound,
that she had left very ill in the arms of Lord
L&mdash;. But, alas! the poor little dog was no
more: it had expired in convulsions; and the
group which presented itself, on entering the
breakfast-room, appeared holding a sort of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
coroner&rsquo;s inquest over the body. Lord L.,
still faithful to his charge, held the motionless
favourite on his knee; Mrs. Montgomery sat
near, with a countenance which seemed to say,
&ldquo;all is over!&rdquo; Frances&rsquo; maid and the butler
stood, one with a saucer of milk, the other with
a plate of water, both now become useless;
while Henry pinched, first a foot, then the tail,
then an ear, to ascertain, as he said, whether
the thing were quite dead. Frances gently put
his hand aside, and looked in the doctor&rsquo;s face.
The doctor shook his head. He was asked if
he could say, from the symptoms, what had
caused the creature&rsquo;s death?</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poison, madam! poison!&rdquo; he replied, without
hesitation.</p>

<p>Henry reddened. &ldquo;It does not admit of a
doubt, madam!&rdquo; continued the doctor, &ldquo;the
animal has died by poison.&rdquo;   The servants had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
their own opinion, as to who had given the
poison, but were silent.&mdash;Such are the beginnings
of crime.</p>

<p>Poor Edmund had now been some days an
inmate of Lodore House, but, as yet, no one
had been able to discover who or what he was:
while from himself no replies could be obtained,
but sobs and terrified looks.</p>

<p>One morning Frances sent for him to the
breakfast-room, and, after giving him many
good things, began a kind of questioning, which
she hoped might draw some information from
the child, without alarming him: such as,
Where was his home? Where was the place
where he used always to be? He replied,
&ldquo;No where.&rdquo; Was there any one that used
to love him? &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said. She now
thought she had found a clue to some useful
discovery, and asked him, who it was that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
loved him? &ldquo;You do,&rdquo; he replied. Frances
took him on her knee, and put her questions in
low whispers; upon which, when she asked
him particularly about the large bruise on the
side of his leg, he stole his little arms round
her neck, and breathed softly in her ear, &ldquo;She
wanted to break it off.&rdquo; &ldquo;Who, my dear,
wanted to break it off?&rdquo; &ldquo;My mother.&rdquo;
Then, alarmed at the great effort he had made,
he became more silent than ever, and looked
so much distressed, that at last, for his own
relief, he was dismissed in charge of good Mrs.
Smyth. While Frances, inspired by the same
sentiment which had guided the righteous judgment
of Solomon, felt convinced that the woman,
whoever she might be, who could treat a
child so barbarously, was not its real mother.
Mrs. Montgomery was herself disposed to entertain
the same opinion; she, however, laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
at the romantic deduction attempted to be
made by Frances, that Edmund therefore must
be the child of parents in an exalted rank in
life.</p>

<p>While the ladies were discussing this point,
Mr. Lauson, an attorney resident at Keswick,
came in to pay his respects: for he was agent
to the Cumberland and Westmoreland estates,
as well as general man of business to the family.
Lauson had passed Mrs. Smyth and Edmund
in the hall, and had looked rather hard at the
child. As soon as the morning salutations
were ended, and he had taken his seat, he
pointed with his thumb over his shoulder towards
the door, which was behind him, saying,
&ldquo;What child&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; And, without waiting
for a reply, he added, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d be sworn but it&rsquo;s
the boy that was begging about at the regatta
with one leg.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;With one leg!&rdquo; interrupted Frances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; said Lauson; &ldquo;but I saw him
myself find the other, so there is nothing so
surprising in his having the two now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The ladies requested an explanation, and
Mr. Lauson gave the best he could, by recounting
as much as he had witnessed of the
scene which opens our history.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> about six weeks the marriage of Frances
and Lord L&mdash; took place, and the happy
couple set off for Beech Park, his lordship&rsquo;s
seat, near London. Within the following ten
days Mrs. Montgomery made all her home arrangements,
paid her pensioners, gave orders for
the Christmas dinner of the neighbouring poor,
placed Edmund in the peculiar care of Mrs.
Smyth; and, finally, the day before she set out
to join her daughter and son-in-law, dispatched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Henry, under escort of the butler, back to S&mdash;
B&mdash; school. The school, as we have before
observed, was an excellent, though a cheap
one; but the lodging was such as Mrs. Montgomery
certainly would not have selected for
her nephew, nor indeed suffered him to occupy,
could she have known the scenes and society
into which it threw him.</p>

<p>Henry arrived at the village of S&mdash; B&mdash;,
and jumped out of the carriage at the door of
a butcher&rsquo;s house. While the servant was
taking out the luggage, Henry addressed, very
familiarly, a woman who stood with her back
to him; and accommodating his language, as
was his custom, to his company, said, &ldquo;Weel,
Katty, and whoo is&rsquo;t wee aw wee you?&rdquo; &ldquo;No
mickle the better for yeer axin!&rdquo; she replied,
continuing her washing. The next moment
Henry was engaged in a game of romps with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
fine girl of fourteen, who just then came in from
the garden: all the flowers which had lately
bloomed there collected in her apron, to be tied
up in penny bunches for the ensuing day&rsquo;s
market. On receiving, though not, it must be
confessed, without richly deserving it, a smart
slap on the ear from his fair antagonist, the
young gentleman closed with her, and commenced
an absolute boxing-match. At this
juncture the butcher himself entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s aw this? what&rsquo;s aw this?&rdquo; he exclaimed.
The angry voice of David Park (such
was the butcher&rsquo;s name) ended the scuffle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Henry and me was no&rsquo; but larking,
fether,&rdquo; replied his daughter, adjusting her
disordered hair and drapery, and gathering up
her scattered flowers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Henry! Mr. Deevil!&rdquo; said the man,
recognising Henry with a scowl. <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>&ldquo;Bonny
larking truly!&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;bonny larking
truly! And what business had you, wife, to
aloo of ony sic work?&rdquo; And he sat down sullenly,
deterred from taking signal vengeance on
the laughing young gentleman, by the dread of
losing his lodger. &ldquo;Bonny larking truly!&rdquo; he
resumed, as, without looking round, he poked
the fire before which he had seated himself, and
began to light his pipe. &ldquo;Ye&rsquo;ll soon be oure
aul&rsquo;, te lark afther that gate wi&rsquo; the scholar
lads, I can tell yee!&rdquo; Here he glanced at his
daughter, and added, &ldquo;Git awaw wi&rsquo; ye, and

<p>We shall here leave Henry to keep such
society, and to follow such pursuits unmolested,
and give our attention again to other and more
amiable personages of our history.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Months</span> had rolled away. It was a beautiful
evening in the middle of July; and Lodore
House, which had been deserted by most of its
inhabitants about the latter end of last October,
when the trees were almost leafless, and the
voice of the fall loud with the swell of wintry
torrents, now looked with a cheerful aspect from
amid embowering verdure. The lofty head of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Skiddaw arose with great majesty above the
woods immediately behind the house, and the
calm lake spread abroad in front, and bounded
by the wide amphitheatre of the Keswick mountains,
filled the mind with pleasing ideas of
peace and retirement. The building, in its own
outline, was picturesque; running along in
light corridors, connecting its principal parts.
Numerous glass doors, or French windows,
leading out on the lawn, were all standing open.
A table, covered with fruit and other refreshments,
might be just peeped at through one of
these; musical instruments, freed from their
cases, appeared through others, and through
more might be discerned, sofas, book-stands,
work-tables, Turkey carpets, reposé chairs, Italian
vases, bronze lamps, cut-glass lustres, hothouse
plants, French beds, swing mirrors, &amp;c.:
while the intervention of silk and muslin dra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>peries,
permitting each object to be but imperfectly
seen, left imagination free to deck the
whole with the charms of fairy-land. Indeed,
from what did appear, it was evident that the
sitting-rooms were numerous, and richly furnished;
that one corridor was a green house, another
a conservatory; and that the wings contained
library, music-room, billiard-room, and
several sleeping and dressing-rooms, all on the
ground floor, all opening on the smooth turf,
and displaying, or rather betraying, enough of
their arrangements to show that, not only convenience,
but luxury had been studied in their
fitting up.</p>

<p>On the outside, ever-blowing roses, with jessamine,
honeysuckle and clematis, bloomed in
abundance, climbing around the casements, and
creeping along the palings: while a gay assemblage
of the choicest and sweetest flowers occu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>pied
plots, scattered irregularly on the velvet
green.</p>

<p>The evening song of myriads of birds was
pouring from the deep woods with every
wild variety of note, rendered the more remarkable
by the monotonous sound of the
now subdued murmur of the fall, which still
went on, on, like the studied sameness of a
judicious accompaniment, selected to give
effect to the varied excursions of the singer&rsquo;s
voice.</p>

<p>Though the sun was still above the horizon,
many bonfires were already lit at various distances
along the road. The immediate approach
was crouded with people, looking full of expectation.
Detached groups were advancing in
different directions; and, here and there, individuals
had climbed trees, or elevated portions
of rock, and seemed looking out for something.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
Every now and then, Mrs. Smyth, dressed in a
holiday suit, came forth from some one or other
of the many open doors, held up her hand to
shade the glare of light from her eyes, looked
towards the lake for a few moments, and returned
in again. Then, would some beautiful
exotic be seen to change its position on some
flower-stand; next a drapery would be let
down from the golden pin which had held it,
and hung again, we suppose, with more grace,
at least in the opinion of good Mrs. Smyth,
whose form glided on through long corridors,
from time to time appearing, disappearing, and
re-appearing; and generally followed by that of
a child that seemed, at every step, to leap and
gambol for very glee.</p>

<p>At length, a carriage was seen driving, at a
rapid pace, along the borders of Derwent-water.
Every thing bright about it sparkled in the rays<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
of the setting sun. A universal shout arose,
and all became hurry and motion. The carriage
approached: it was a barouche thrown
open, and, seated in it, were Mrs. Montgomery
and Lord and Lady L. They bowed, smiled,
and waved their hands on every side. But soon
the attention of the latter lady was entirely engrossed
by the appearance of a lovely little boy,
whom Mrs. Smyth, as she descended the lawn,
led by the hand; and in whom, but for one
touching expression, imperceptible perhaps to
any other eye than Frances&rsquo;, no one could have
recognized poor Edmund. The rich dark locks,
the profusion of which had formerly added the
look of wild neglect to that of misery, now flew
back as he ran against the wind, displaying and
giving contrast to a forehead white and open.
The late hollow cheeks were now rounded, dimpled,
and glowing, at once with exercise and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
delight. His mouth, always beautiful in its
form, and so very sweet in its movements, had
now all the advantages of rosy lips and happy
smiles. While his eyes, which from their being
large, and adorned by peculiarly long lashes,
had once seemed to occupy the chief part of his
face, now but served to give soul to the more
earthly beauties, which the good cheer of Mrs.
Smyth had supplied.</p>

<p>Edmund had got a few paces before his conductress.
He stretched forward both hands,
and leaped up with a bound towards the door,
as he reached the side of the carriage. Lady L.
pulled the check-string. The carriage stopped,
and Edmund, whom by its rapid motion it
had already passed some yards, was brought
back by a servant, and lifted in. Such was
his joy, that the poor little creature could not
speak! He trembled excessively, and, for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
moment or two, his features were almost
convulsed by his struggles not to cry: he
thought it would seem as if he were not glad,
and he knew he was very glad. A few tears,
however, forced their way; but they only hung
in the long lashes, shining like early dew-drops,
while happiness sparkled through them: for
now, encouraged and caressed, he sat on Lady
L.&rsquo;s knee, and hugged one of her hands. Yet,
when he looked up in her face and tried to
speak, his little lip trembled again, and his little
countenance assumed an expression of feeling
beyond his years, which early sorrow had taught
the infant features. Lady L. kissed his forehead
and passed her hand over it, to wipe
away, as it were, the trace of care; while an
ardent desire swelled in her heart to screen this
object of her tender compassion from every
painful vicissitude of life, accompanied, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>ever,
by a sigh to think how vain the wish!
This sigh was followed by yet another, as, from
association, the very natural idea presented itself,
that it must be also impossible for her
effectually to shelter from the changes and
chances of mortal existence, even the babe, that
destined to be born under auspices so different,
would, in a few months, make her really a mother.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montgomery rallied, and Lord L. complimented
her on her discernment; declaring
that they never had seen any thing half so beautiful
as her unpromising favourite had turned
out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not think me illiberal,&rdquo; said Lady L.;
&ldquo;but I cannot imagine this the child of coarse,
vulgar parents&mdash;a creature that seems all soul!
See, with what an intelligent countenance he
listens to every thing that is said!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>
<p>Mrs. Montgomery smiled; and Lord L.,
anxious to please a wife with whom he was still
in love, was about to express himself quite of
her opinion.</p>

<p>The discussion was, however, for the present
broken off by the stopping of the carriage amid
shouts of joyous welcome. While the merry
groups around the bonfires drank the healths of
our family party, its members seated themselves
at a most inviting looking table, which we have
long half seen from behind a muslin curtain.</p>

<p>The agreeable summer supper they here
found prepared for their entertainment, consisted
chiefly of fruit, of which little Edmund,
placed between Lady L. and Mrs. Montgomery,
was permitted to partake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; remarked her partial ladyship,
after observing the child for a time, &ldquo;with all
the gentleness of his nature, there is no slavish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
awe of superiors about him. Do you know, I
almost fancy I can discern an innate consciousness
of being in his right place when he is with
us: it would seem as though, however long he
had been in the hands of those wretches, the
impressions of absolute infancy, and of the caresses
and tender treatment experienced, (if my
conjecture is correct,) during that period, were
never entirely effaced; for, that though they
were not within the reach of memory to recall
with any thing like distinctness, association
possessed a mysterious power of bringing every
thing similar to them home to the feelings.
Can you imagine so nice a distinction? I can,&rdquo;
she added, turning to Lord L.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are few,&rdquo; replied his lordship, &ldquo;who
have not, I should think, experienced the feeling
of which you speak. Of this class are all the
sensations of pleasure or of pain, occasioned by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
sounds or sights possessing in their own natures
no corresponding qualities. How often, for
instance, do we hear people say of an air, by no
means solemn. &lsquo;That tune always makes me
melancholy: it reminds me of something, though
I cannot remember what.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>This sort of conversation naturally led to the
subject of Edmund&rsquo;s future prospects. It
seemed tacitly yielded to the evident wishes of
Lady L., that his profession should be that of
a gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Lord L., &ldquo;it will be the
best way to give the boy a liberal education:
and when he is of an age to judge for himself,
let him choose for himself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Montgomery expressed the same opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing can be kinder, I am sure!&rdquo; said
Lady L., giving a hand to each, and seeming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
to take the obligation entirely to herself: then
looking at Edmund, she added, after a moment&rsquo;s
pause, &ldquo;I dare say, he will choose to be a clergyman,
the benevolent duties of that sacred office
will suit so well with his gentle temper. Should
you not like to be a clergyman, my dear&mdash;like
the gentleman who reads in the church every
Sunday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to be a sailor boy,&rdquo; said Edmund.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A sailor boy!&rdquo; repeated Lady L. &ldquo;Poor
child!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, my brave fellow!&rdquo; exclaimed
Lord L. &ldquo;You see, Frances, he will not be so
very gentle after all! Less than a year of good
feeding and kind treatment have already brought
out his English spirit. If he continue of this
opinion, I can obtain his admittance into the
naval college at Portsmouth; after which, I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
put him forward in his profession with all the
interest I can command.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Things being thus arranged, so much to
Lady L.&rsquo;s satisfaction, the family retired for the
night.</p>

&ldquo;Thou wilt see him.&rdquo;<br />

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Montgomery</span> received an account, in the
morning, from Mrs. Smyth, of how good Edmund
had been, and of his having become so
great a favourite, not only with the good doctor,
but also with the clergyman, that both
had had him to dine and play with their children
more than once. She also reported, with
great self gratulation, the very uncommon progress
he had made in learning, under her
tuition; and then proceeded to relate an ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>venture
she had met with one evening, when
walking with Edmund.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were just returning,&rdquo; said Mrs. Smyth,
&ldquo;from Keswick, where I had been taking a cup
of tea wee a vara discreet neighbour. I carried
the boy wee me, for I niver like to let a child
that is in my care oot o&rsquo; my sight; it&rsquo;s a thing
I nivir did, and Edmund is ne trouble; tack
him whar ye will, he awways behaves himsel so
prettily. So just as we were walking quietly up
the hill, before ye git under the shade o&rsquo; the
trees, hearing voices, I happened to look ehint
me, when I saw following us a dacent, vara gentleman
looking man, in earnest conversation with
a woman, wha from her rags, and the whiff o&rsquo;
spirituous liquor I found as she passed, seemed
a beggar o&rsquo; the maist disreputable kind. They
keep&rsquo;t looking, looking, still at little Edmund,
as they spoke; and though, when I think upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
it, it seems as though ony body might look at
his bonny face, heaven love him! yet at the
time I felt within myself parfact sure &rsquo;at they
were no looking at him for the sake o&rsquo; looking
at him. As they cam&rsquo; past I heard the man
say, &lsquo;Well, I suppose she&rsquo;ll be satisfied, now
that I have seen him myself.&rsquo; I am quite sure
o&rsquo; these words, but they went on, and I could
hear no more. It seemed so strange like, I
thought, to follow and speak wee them, when I
felt the bairn pull me by the hand; I looked
round, and he was trembling aw over, and as
pale as death. By the time I had speered at
him what ailed him, and spoken him a word
o&rsquo; comfort, the man and the woman were bathe
gane, and the peur thing talt me, that yon
graceless wretch was his mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Much commenting followed, on the part of
Mrs. Smyth, which it is unnecessary to repeat;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
while Mrs. Montgomery could not refrain from
expressing great regret, that so favourable an
opportunity had been lost for compelling the
vagrant to give some account of herself, and
of the child. The subject was, of course,
discussed in the breakfast-room, but nothing
could be made of it, except that it would seem
there did exist some one who took an interest in
Edmund, and who might yet claim him, when
their reasons for mystery were at an end. But
then, their choice of such an agent as the
drunken beggar, was quite unaccountable; for,
had she stolen the child, why should she be in
the confidence of the decent man, who, it seems,
was to satisfy the child&rsquo;s friends, by being able
to say that he had seen him himself. The most
diligent search was made in the neighbourhood,
but neither man nor woman could be heard of.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montgomery and Lady L. now under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>took
the instruction of Edmund themselves,
till proper arrangements should be made respecting
that point, lest he should acquire too
much of good Mrs. Smyth&rsquo;s accent; yet that
discreet lady was far from thinking any such
precaution necessary, as she prided herself on
reading English with great precision, and indulging
in her native idiom only in familiar
conversation, for the sake, as she averred, of
&ldquo;Auld lang syne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This plan of the lessons brought Edmund
much into the sitting-rooms, till, by degrees, it
passed into a custom for him to remain all the
morning with the ladies. Then, when particularly
good, he was indulged with a sort of
second dinner at the table: and he was always
good, so that there was no opportunity to withdraw
an indulgence once granted, and, very
shortly, a chair and plate were set for him at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
every meal, as a matter of course; while every
one grew so fond of him, that it seemed forgotten
he was not a child of the family, and
even the servants, of their own accord, all
began to call him Master Edmund.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> the mean time preparations of every kind
were making for Lady L.&rsquo;s expected confinement.
The doctor had an apartment assigned
him, and now lived at Lodore House, lest his
attendance should be a moment too late. A
respectable woman, of approved abilities, arrived
all the way from Edinburgh. She was
provided with an assistant under-nurse from
Keswick, and both established at Lodore. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>ferings
too, at the shrine of the expected
stranger, made their appearance every day.
A splendid set of caudle-cups, of very curious
china, was sent from London by Lady Theodosia
R., a sister of Lord L. A set of baby-linen,
of needle-work the most exquisite, arrived
from Scotland, sent by Major Morven, a
rather elderly bachelor-brother of Mrs. Montgomery&rsquo;s.
The major mentioned in his letter,
that, as he did not understand those things
himself, he had had them chosen by a committee
of ladies, the best judges in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Many, indeed, were the little, very little
things, which came from various quarters, more
than we entirely understand ourselves; but
every band-box that was opened produced something
little, so that it seemed a sort of importation
from the Liliputian world. Little hats
of white beaver, like snow-balls, in which, how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>ever,
little plumes were not forgotten. Little
caps, little bonnets, and even little shoes,
wrapped in silver paper. In short, there was
nothing big, but the good woman from Edinburgh,
and Major Morven. The major came
to be in time for the christening, as he was to
be one of the sponsors.</p>

<p>At length another little arrival took place,
and a beautiful little girl commenced her
earthly pilgrimage. Quickly was the young
stranger dressed in the raiment of needle-work,
and carried by its grandmamma, and followed by
its nurse, to the drawing-room, there to receive
the caresses, and claim the admiration of its
happy papa. There also was Edmund, wondering
much at the bustle, and at his lessons
having been entirely omitted. His ecstacies of
delight and astonishment on seeing the baby
were so great, and his entreaties so eager, first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
to be allowed to look at, then to touch this
quite new object of wonder, all the time trying
each expedient to add to his height, now leaping
straight up, now climbing the chair nearest
to Lord L., then the arm of the sofa, and,
finally, the sofa-table itself, to the imminent
danger of his neck, that Mrs. Montgomery
was at length induced, after making him sit
down on the said table, to hold the infant, for
a second or two, across his knees.</p>

<p>During those seconds it was, we have good
reason to believe, that the first idea of self-importance
ever entertained by our hero, entered
his mind: it accompanied the proud consciousness
of fancying that he afforded support
to a creature more helpless than himself. He
touched its soft cheek, then its miniature hand,
which soon began to close itself round his
finger, in the manner that infants do. It seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
to Edmund, as though his caresses were kindly
returned. His little heart overflowed with
fondness. He looked up, his face beaming with
delight, and asked if he might kiss the darling
little baby.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A pretty bold request indeed!&rdquo; said
Lord L., laughing, &ldquo;kiss my eldest daughter,
you urchin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Montgomery, laughing also, told him
he might, and Edmund accordingly approached
his rosy lips to those of his precious charge,
with, however, the greatest gentleness, lest, as
he said, he should hurt it.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montgomery, on her return back from
the drawing-room, was much surprised to hear
the cry of an infant inside her daughter&rsquo;s apartment,
while she herself, if she were not dreaming,
held the baby in her own arms, outside
the door. The fact was, an occurrence had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
taken place, which, with all their preparation,
they were not at all prepared for. A second
little girl had made her appearance. Two
dress caps, certainly, had been provided, one
with a cockade for a boy, the other with a
suitable rosette for a girl, in case of such a contingency
(and bad enough in all conscience)
as that of the child being a girl, after doctor,
nurse, servants, tenants, and indeed every one
knowing perfectly well that it would be a boy,
but two girls never had been so much as
thought of. The elder young lady, therefore,
by three-quarters of an hour, being already in
possession of the girl&rsquo;s rosette, the younger was
obliged to make her first public appearance in
this world of vanities, figuring in a boy&rsquo;s
cockade.</p>

<p>To prevent, however, a serious disappointment
on the part of Lord L., an explanatory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
message was sent to him before she was permitted
to enter the drawing-room. There was
but one child&rsquo;s nurse, too; but what with grandmamma&rsquo;s
help, and good Mrs. Smyth&rsquo;s assistance,
and Edmund&rsquo;s, which he judicially afforded, by
running under every body&rsquo;s feet who carried a
baby, they contrived to manage till a second
nurse could be procured.</p>

<p>We speak of nurses under certain limitations;
for Lady L. had been too well instructed by
her mother, in every right sentiment, to meditate
for a moment depriving her infants of the
nutriment nature had ordained for them.</p>

<p>The doctor, as soon as he thought he could
venture to assert that there would be no more,
either boys or girls, frisked into the drawing-room,
rubbing his hands, and smiling with perfect
satisfaction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I give your lordship,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;joy, twice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
told! twice told! I believe I am justified in so
doing on the present twofold occasion. Twofold,
heigh? twofold it certainly is, literally so,
and twofold should be our rejoicing; else are
we ungrateful for the bounty of Providence,
and the liberality of nature! Liberality of nature,
heigh?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;,&rdquo; said his lordship, with a countenance
of some anxiety.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We did not anticipate this, sir,&rdquo; continued
the doctor, &ldquo;this is a contingency that we did
not anticipate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray&mdash;,&rdquo; recommenced Lord L., making a
fresh effort to be heard; but the doctor proceeded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two beautiful girls, upon my life&mdash;beautiful!
I already see future conquests sparkling
in their eyes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure, doctor,&rdquo; asked the major,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
&ldquo;there won&rsquo;t be any more? A boy now,
eh? Girls first: all right that&mdash;<i>Place aux
dames</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The next,&rdquo; proceeded the doctor, still addressing
Lord L., &ldquo;shall be a boy. At present
two <i>belles</i> have been sent us, and we
should make them joy <i>belles</i>! eh? Come,
that&rsquo;s rather good, a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; And with his
usual pirouette, he flung himself on the sofa beside
the major, threw one leg across the other,
and with his head a little back, and on one side,
looked up and smiled with entire self-complacency.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montgomery now appeared at the door,
to give Lord L. the long-wished-for summons;
which he obeyed on tip-toe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Scotland, I presume, sir?&rdquo; said the
doctor to his neighbour on the sofa.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Ee noo, sir,&rdquo; replied the major; &ldquo;bit hoo
did ye ken I cam frae Scotland? No by my
speech, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir, the name&mdash;the name,&rdquo; returned the
doctor, a little disconcerted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Morven is a weel kent name, dootless,&rdquo; rejoined
the man of war; &ldquo;and for my speech,
I should tack ney sham that it savoured o&rsquo; the
land o&rsquo; my nativity, provided sic was the case;
bit it fell oot, that being much wee my regiment,
on the sarvice o&rsquo; his Majesty, I ha&rsquo; been
full saxteen year o&rsquo; my life oot o&rsquo; Scotland; se
that noo, when I gang to Lunnon, ne body kens
me till be a Scotchman: that is, by my speech.
Bit ne&rsquo; doot&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here the doctor, who had kept silence unusually
long (perhaps from admiration of the
major&rsquo;s pure English), interrupted his companion,
to descant on use or custom being second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
nature, &amp;c. And the major being one of the
many who never listen to anybody&rsquo;s speeches but
their own, leaned back on the sofa, and fell
asleep.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> christening was quite a splendid festival.
A number of friends and relations, among whom
was Lady Theodosia R., became inmates of
Lodore House for the occasion. All the neighbourhood
was invited to join their party for the
day; and the tenantry and poor people entertained
on the lawn and borders of the lake;
while the inhabitants of the town of Keswick
illuminated their houses to show their respect
and affection for the family.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>The names of Julia and Frances were given
to the little girls. The ceremony was over, and
Edmund, who had been dressed very sprucely for
the great occasion, was standing near one of the
nurses, endeavouring to pacify his baby, as he
invariably called the eldest of the twins. The
young lady was evincing her displeasure at the
drops of cold water which had visited, so suddenly,
the nice warm glow produced on her
cheek by the full lace border of her cap, and
the sheltering shawl of her nurse.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montgomery, who was looking on much
amused at the little man&oelig;uvres of Edmund, naturally
recollected (the whole business being
about names) that he, poor fellow, had but one
appellation, and though that did very well now,
the case would be altered when he began to go
among strangers, when some sort of surname
would become quite indispensable. She chanced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to express her thoughts on the subject (in an
under tone of course) to Lady L. and Mr.
Jackson, who were standing near her, adding,
that as there was no name over which she had
so good a right as her own, she thought he had
better in future be called Montgomery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you quite determined, madam?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Jackson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, quite,&rdquo; she replied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come here, then, my dear little fellow!&rdquo;
proceeded the worthy clergyman, addressing
Edmund in an elevated tone.</p>

<p>Edmund obeyed timidly, but immediately.</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson still stood opposite to the font,
though, his sacred duties being ended, he had
descended the steps previous to the foregoing
conversation, which took place while the congregation
were moving out of church.</p>

<p>The figure and countenance of Mr. Jackson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
were fine and impressive, and his air and carriage
lent to them all the dignity which the
Ruler of nature intended man to derive from
his upright form, when the mind is upright
too. The infantine figure at his knee seemed,
by contrast, to add nobleness to his stature.
His eyes were raised to heaven, those of the
child to his face, as laying one hand on Edmund&rsquo;s
head, and extending the other, he pronounced
with solemnity the following words:</p>

<p>&ldquo;May the Almighty Father of the fatherless,
and Defender of the orphan&rsquo;s cause, bless,
guide, and protect you, under the name of
Edmund Montgomery, till your claim (if you
have such) to any other shall be known and
acknowledged.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tones of his voice were fine; and, on
this occasion, a tenderness was blended with
their depth, supplied by the growing partiality<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
he had for some time felt for poor Edmund;
while his naturally grave and almost severe
deportment, borrowed, when, as now, he had
been recently engaged in divine service, a grace
from his piety, a humility which yet elevated:
it was a consciousness, visible, of standing in
the presence of his Maker.</p>

<p>When our party had come out of church,
and were waiting under some trees in the little
green that surrounded the building, for the
carriages to come up in convenient order, Mr.
Jackson, who still held Edmund by the hand,
turned to Mrs. Montgomery, and, with an enthusiasm
peculiar to himself, and the very
glow of which prevented his perceiving that
he not unfrequently produced a smile on the
lips of those who were not capable of entering
into his feelings, said, &ldquo;This child, madam, is
a more perfect personification of my ideas of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
what the angels must be, than any thing I
have ever before met with, or even read of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You except the ladies, I hope,&rdquo; said Lady
Theodosia, &ldquo;or, at least, those of the present
company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I make no exceptions, madam,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Jackson, with but little gallantry of voice
or manner. Then turning again to Mrs. Montgomery,
he was about to proceed; but Lady
Theodosia ran on thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is certainly customary to say of any fine
fat child, that it is quite a cherub; but I cannot
see why a perfection so earthly, should lay
exclusive claim to the attribute of angels!
The Edinburgh sick nurse, in that case, would
be the most angelic creature among us, for she
must measure, as Sir John Falstaff says of
himself, at least three yards round the waist.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Theodosia was very thin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My premises, madam, led to no such monstrous
conclusion!&rdquo; replied Mr. Jackson, with
much more severity of tone than the occasion
called for.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Monstrous conclusion!&rdquo; echoed the doctor.
&ldquo;Come, that&rsquo;s very good! The person your
ladyship has just mentioned, is somewhat monstrous,
it cannot be denied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson, meanwhile, with a gravity not
to be shaken, proceeded addressing Mrs. Montgomery
as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;In my mental visions, I
have often indulged in speculations on the possible
appearance of angels. I have, &rsquo;tis true,
always pictured them to myself decked in that
freshness of beauty peculiar to extreme youth;
yet, on the brow, I have imagined an expression
resembling what may be traced here!&rdquo;
and he passed his hand over the forehead of
Edmund.   Then taking off the little plumed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
Scotch bonnet, and viewing him as he spoke,
he continued: &ldquo;That look, I had almost said
of thought, that touch of sentiment, scarcely
corresponding with the dimpled and infantine
loveliness of the cheek: that smile too, of perfect
happiness, emanating from the blissful consciousness
of never even wishing wrong! No
seeds of jarring passions there, madam! no
contentions of spirit: but that absolute harmony
of soul, so rarely to be met with on earth,
when every impulse of the native will is in
unison with the sense of right implanted in all,
by the great Author and Source of good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Theodosia was dying to laugh, but
dare not, Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s face was so perfectly
serious. Edmund looked up at the moment,
conscious that he was spoken of, though, of
course, not comprehending what was said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The eye,&rdquo; continued Mr. Jackson, &ldquo;when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
it meets yours, certainly conveys a tender appeal,
a silent claim on protection, that we
scarcely expect in that of a superior intelligence.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Theodosia philosophically observed,
that the child&rsquo;s hair was black, and that angels
were always depicted with golden locks. (Her
ladyship&rsquo;s were auburn, bordering on red.)
&ldquo;And as to supposing,&rdquo; continued the lady,
&ldquo;that angels must invariably be children,&rdquo;
(Lady Theodosia was no child,) &ldquo;it is quite
an erroneous idea. Milton&rsquo;s angels were of all
ages.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there were no ladies among them,
Theodosia!&rdquo; said Lord L., just coming up.
&ldquo;Lovers call you angels, but brothers and
married men may speak the truth; and, it
must be confessed, that all the angels upon record
are either children or young men.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh fie! my lord,&rdquo; ventured the doctor;
&ldquo;is it not recorded every day before our
eyes, in the fairest characters,&rdquo; bowing and
smiling to Lady Theodosia, &ldquo;that the ladies
are angels! Fair characters! fair characters!
Come, that&rsquo;s fair, very fair, a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 6em;">&ldquo;There is nothing great,</span><br />
Which religion does not teach; nothing good,<br />
Of which she is not the eternal source;<br />
At once the motive and the recompense.&rdquo;<br />

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">From</span> the evening of the birth of Lady L.&rsquo;s
babies, it was evident that our hero, though
not yet seven years old, no longer thought
himself little. He assumed a manly air and
carriage, and could not bear the idea of being
suspected of wanting assistance or protection.
He, indeed, was always ready to give his assistance,
if one of the babies stretched a little
hand for any thing, or his protection, if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
bark of a dog, the sight of a stranger, or any
such awful occurrence, alarmed either of them;
or his soothings, if they cried.</p>

<p>He would no longer hold by any one&rsquo;s hand
in walking, but would step out in front of the
nursery party, with quite a proud air, looking
over his shoulder, from time to time, and telling
the nurses that he was going first, to see
that there was nothing there to hurt the babies.
He often asked if they would ever be as big
as he was; and always kept alive, by perpetual
inquiries, and additional caresses, a perfect
recollection of the identity of the eldest baby&mdash;the
one that had been held across his arms, the
evening it was born; and which, at the moment
it seemed to clasp his finger, had awakened in
his little breast the first emotion of tenderness,
that was not accompanied by that almost awe-inspiring
feeling&mdash;a grateful looking up, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
from an immeasurable distance, to beings, in
whose love and protection he himself sought
shelter.</p>

<p>The partiality evinced by Mr. Jackson for
our hero, on the day of the christening, encouraged
Mrs. Montgomery to put in immediate
execution a plan which Lady L. and herself
had been for some time meditating; namely, to
request that gentleman to undertake the education
of Edmund, till he was of an age to be
sent to the Naval College.</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson was eminently fitted for the
task of instructing youth. He had been a
fellow of one of the universities, and distinguished
both for his learning and his talents.</p>

<p>Since his retirement from college on his present
living, he had enjoyed much leisure, and
had devoted it to elegant studies: modern
classics, modern languages, the fine arts, late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
discoveries in science, &amp;c. &amp;c. In short, to use
his own words, he had, since that period, wandered
daily through the pleasure-grounds of
literature; not suffering his mind to sink into
utter indolence, yet giving it no more than the
healthful stimulus of gentle exercise. He was
born a poet, but had, through life, indulged
more in poetical feelings than in poetical effusions;
unless, indeed, we admit as such, the
energetic overflowing of his spontaneous eloquence
in conversation; for his sermons, he
took care, should be plain and practical. He
was not a shepherd, who, at the instigation of
vanity, would turn the green pasture-lands of
his flock into beds of tulips. Yet did not the
pure and perspicuous style, which good taste,
as well as good feeling, taught him to adopt on
sacred subjects, want for that true sublime
which is derived from simplicity, when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
grandeur of the thought itself leaves laboured
language far behind.</p>

<p>The topic on which he was unwearied was,
the inseparable connexion between right faith
and right practice, and between both and happiness.
He proved, by the most beautiful and
feeling arguments and illustrations, that, like
the root, the blossom, and the fruit, they grew
out of, necessarily produced, and, as necessarily,
could not exist without each other. He
then proceeded to show, that the whole chain
of natural causes and effects formed one unbroken,
practical revelation of the Almighty
will, ordaining virtue and forbidding vice; inasmuch
as not only is virtue necessary to make
us capable of happiness even here, but out of
vice invariably grows suffering, not only moral,
but generally physical also, lest the lowest
capacity should be slow to comprehend this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
manifestation of the sovereign purpose of him
who called us into being, but bestows upon us
that felicity, towards which, his all-wise government
is constituted to lead us; of him who,
had it been possible even to infinite power, to
bestow a consciousness of individuality of spiritual
being, without an equal consciousness of
freedom of will, would have rendered it impossible
for his creatures to err; or, in other
words, to forfeit that bliss which &ldquo;eye hath
not seen, ear heard, neither hath it entered into
the heart of man to conceive.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;For,&rdquo; our Christian philosopher would add,
as he drew his arguments to their close, &ldquo;had
that emanation of the divinity which is the soul
of man, been without choice between good and
evil; or, in other words, necessitated to act by
no other impulse than that of its great source,
the Almighty had created but a material world,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
all spiritual intelligence, the whole soul of the
universe, had still been God himself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s imaginings, especially when
he walked alone amid the majestic scenery that
surrounded his dwelling, certainly were poetry;
but he seldom interrupted his pleasing reveries,
or checked his nights of fancy, to place them
on paper, or even to arrange them in any precise
order of words. Indeed, it was one of his
favourite positions, (and he was famous for
theories of his own,) that a man might be a
poet, without possessing one word of any language
whatsoever, in which to express his
poetic ideas.</p>

<p>In judging a new work, too, he seldom descended
to verbal criticism; but, taking an
enlarged view of the spirit in which the thing
was written, pronounced it, at once, to want, or
to possess, that poetical spark, that vivifying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
principle, which must, he maintained, breathe a
soul into every composition, whether prose or
verse, worth the trouble of reading.</p>

<p>To complete Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s qualifications for
a preceptor, he himself found a sensible pleasure
in imparting knowledge. Let others prove
the wonders, the properties, the virtues of all
that the material world affords; and, admired
be their curious, and respected their useful
labours; but the natural philosophy in which he
delighted, was the development of the young
mind. In his mode, too, of communicating instruction,
there was a peculiar felicity. He
never required of a pupil an arbitrary act of
mere memory: &ldquo;indeed,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;there
is no such a power as mere memory.&rdquo; What is
commonly called having a good memory, he
considered as nothing more than the natural
result of fixing the attention, awaking the feel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>ings,
and forming the associations. These last,
he termed the roots, by which remembrances
entwine themselves with our whole constitution,
till the very heart vibrates to a sound, a colour,
or but the scent of a flower, plucked in the
day of joy, or of sorrow. He, therefore, always
endeavoured to lead the understanding to facts,
through their causes; and, again, to interest
the feelings in the consequences of those facts:
thus were the lessons he taught never to be
effaced. Above all things, he hasted to supply
the infant mind with salutary associations, on
every subject tending to implant principles and
form character; considering every avenue of
the soul, not thus timely fortified, as laid open
to the incursions of wrong, perhaps, fatal
opinions. For instance, whilst others railed,
with common-place argument, against bribing
children, as they termed it, into goodness; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
maintained that the lowest animal gratification
of the infant, (that is, before it can understand
any other,) may be so judiciously bestowed, as
to become the first seed of that grand principle,
a thorough conviction that the virtuous only
can enjoy happiness. If the child&rsquo;s daily and
hourly experience prove to it, that when it is
good it has all from which it knows how to derive
pleasure; and that when it is not good,
the reverse is the case; must it not soon learn
to connect, so thoroughly, goodness with happiness,
that, through after-life, the ideas can
never present themselves apart. &ldquo;As mind is
developed,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;let the sources of
the child&rsquo;s happiness be ennobled: teach it to
prize, as its best reward, the love and approval
of its parent; to dread, as its greatest punishment,
the withholding such. And, to acquire
this power, let your tenderest indulgence, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
perpetual sunshine of your countenance, be the
very atmosphere in which your child is reared;
and soon, the sight of features on which no
smile appears, will be chastisement sufficient,
and you be spared the brutalizing and alienating
your offspring, by beating it into forced
obedience, and spontaneous hatred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That such a man as we have described, was
ever found, in the fulfilment of his active duties
as a pastor, the conscientious and benevolent
Christian, we need scarcely add.</p>

<p>The income arising from Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s living
was considerable; and, as he had also
private property, he was quite independent; it
was, therefore, entirely as a favour; that Mrs.
Montgomery meditated requesting him to take
charge of Edmund&rsquo;s education. He, on his
part, came into all her plans and wishes, with
as much readiness and warmth, as his enthu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>siastic
praises of our hero had led her to
hope.</p>

<p>The parsonage, to which Mr. Jackson had
built very elegant additions, stands within a
short walk of Lodore House. Its own situation
is beautiful. Indeed, it is scarcely possible to
choose a spot in this immediate neighbourhood
which is not so. Every distance is terminated
by magnificent mountains. More or less ample
views of the lake, are almost everywhere to
be descried through trees that grow with luxuriance
to the water&rsquo;s-edge; the long vista of
each opening, carpeted with a velvet sod of the
tenderest green; while, where the wooding
climbs the feet of the hills, bare rocks, like the
sides and turrets of ruined castles, protrude in
many parts, giving much beauty and variety to
the scenery. One of the highest of these lifts
itself conspicuously above the grove which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
embowers Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s dwelling, and stands
just in view of his study-windows. It is crowned
by a rent and blasted oak, the outer branches
of which still bud forth every spring, displaying
a partial verdure, while the naked roots are
bound around the rock&rsquo;s hard brow, with a
grasp which has maintained its hold from age
to age, against the winds and rains of countless
winters. Beyond the woods, stupendous Skiddaw
rears its lofty head, enveloped in perpetual
clouds, in much the same manner, that it backs
the view of Lodore House; for in this wild
region, that mountain holds so conspicuous a
place in every scene, that it may almost be said
to be omnipresent.</p>

<p>A window to the south presents some slight
traces of human existence, not discernible from
any of the others: a curious bridge, roughly
constructed, its date unknown, and crossing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
spot where there is now no water; and a single
chimney, with its blue smoke, peeping from the
cleft of a rock, within which is concealed the
little habitation to which it belongs. The
study itself, from which these prospects are
enjoyed, contains an excellent library: it opens
with French windows on the lawn, and communicates
with the drawing-room by means of
a green-house in the corridor form, in imitation
of that at Lodore, from which it had been
stored with choice plants. Beyond the drawing-room,
in the old part of the building, is situated
a comfortable dining-room. To this literary
Eden, our hero each day repaired, reaping from
his visits all the advantages which might be
expected. Thus did matters proceed for about
four years, except that we omitted to mention
that he spent all periods of Mrs. Montgomery&rsquo;s
absence from Lodore House entirely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
at Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s dwelling, by that gentleman&rsquo;s
particular request. Edmund had become the
consolation of his worthy preceptor&rsquo;s lonely
hours, the centre of his affections. Those had,
indeed, no other object. Within the first three
years of Mr. Jackson&rsquo;s marriage, he had lost
a wife to whom he had been attached from early
youth; and, more recently, the measles had
robbed him of both the boys she had left him.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did jealous hate inspire thee?&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Meanwhile</span> the unamiable Henry, every time
he returned from his school for the vacations,
was filled with fresh envy and hatred on beholding
Edmund more and more established in
the rank of a child of the family, and more
and more beloved by every one; while he,
Henry, felt as if at enmity with the whole
world, merely because his own unworthy nature
could not divest itself of an instinctive
consciousness, that he did not deserve to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
loved. He, however, explained the business
very differently: he persuaded himself that the
beggar-brat (as he called Edmund in his own
thoughts, for Mrs. Montgomery would not
suffer him to do so to be heard) had got into
his place, and deprived him of every body&rsquo;s
regard.</p>

<p>As soon as Mrs. Montgomery had been
aware of her nephew&rsquo;s lodging, she had had
him removed to one more eligible; but his low
habits were too strongly confirmed to be much
amended by this salutary change. He still
spent his leisure hours at the butcher&rsquo;s house,
and carried thither the fruits of all his depredations,
namely, the spoils of robbed orchards,
and scaled poultry-yards. There the wife and
daughter would first cook for him, and then,
joining in the carousal, help to demolish. His
rompings too, with Miss Betsy Park, for so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
was the butcher&rsquo;s daughter named, grew daily
more frequent.</p>

<p>The sagacious mother did not choose to interfere,
observing, that though Betsy had become
very saucy to Mr. Henry, and sometimes
even gave him a smart slap in the face, he,
instead of threatening to beat, and not unfrequently
to kick her, as he used to do, was now
often heard to menace her with a good kissing
if she did not behave herself. The damsel,
however, by no means alarmed, would most
generally repeat her offence, and, snapping her
fingers, tell him she defied him; upon which
he would pursue her round the house, back
yard, or garden, to put his threat into execution.
On such occasions, however, he could
not so entirely get rid of his old habits, as to
let Miss Betsy off, without following up his
new species of vengeance, by some of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
cruel pinches which, in childhood, had so often
diversified the snowy surface of the young
lady&rsquo;s skin, with the various tints of black,
blue, and green.</p>

<p>Yet Miss Betsy was, by this time, become
a very fine girl: she was fair, had a glowing
colour, a quantity of light auburn hair, laughing
blue eyes, a saucy nose, full pouting lips,
good white teeth, and was tall and well made,
though, if any thing, a little too fat; but, in
consequence of her youth, this, at present,
rather gave luxuriance to her beauty, than
coarseness to her appearance.</p>

<p>It may be asked, why any thing in the
shape of a mother sanctioned such scenes as we
have alluded to. But too many S&mdash; B&mdash; mothers,
in Mrs. Park&rsquo;s way, speculated on marrying
their daughters to scholar lads, as the
boys and young men are indiscriminately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
termed; and the questionable means employed
by Mrs. Park were not only, in her opinion,
the best to obtain her end, but those sanctioned
by the customs of the village, time immemorial.</p>

<p>By such mothers, while their daughters were
permitted&mdash;we had almost said counselled&mdash;to
cast off all delicacy, a sort of worldly prudence
was taught, by which the necessity of not forfeiting
their chance of marrying a gentleman
was duly impressed on young creatures, whose
habitual manners, from childhood, had early
deprived them of the natural guard of modesty.
Thus, a girl who was forsaken (before
marriage we mean) by a scholar-lad, incurred
direful suspicions in the village; while one
who had so successfully balanced her blandishments,
as to decoy one into marriage, was ever
after held up as a pattern of virtue! This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the more easily managed, when we consider the
respective ages of the parties.</p>

<p>When once these lads left the school, their
brides saw no more of them. The ladies, however,
as soon as the schoolmaster&rsquo;s authority
was at an end, proclaimed their marriage in
the village, called themselves by the gentleman&rsquo;s
name, had some allowance, particularly
if there was a child in the case, and considered
themselves a step higher in the ranks of society.</p>

<p>Henry was not yet seventeen, but he would
be older before he finally quitted the school;
and most of the S&mdash; B&mdash; weddings took place
between mere boys and girls a few years their
seniors.</p>

<p>A custom too prevailed in this village, and
its vicinity, very favourable to suitors&mdash;we mean
among the elevated rank of which we are now
speaking. All received sweethearts, as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
are called, were permitted to sit the whole of
the night by the embers of the kitchen fire,
without witness or candle, beside the damsel to
whom they wished to plead their cause. This
indulgence was granted, whether scholar lad or
labourer, on the plea of the swain, in either
case, having no leisure for love-making by day.
It was a custom, however, which David Park
never permitted in his house, though he had
himself been so favoured when courting Betsy&rsquo;s
mother.</p>

<p>It is reported in the village, that great confusion
exists in the parish register, respecting
the christenings and weddings of many families,
including the butchers. We think, however,
that it must be by a mistake of the old
clerk, when a christening appears actually upon
record before the wedding, the circumstance
being quite out of the course of nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p>Betsy&rsquo;s father, to do him justice, though he
joined in wishing to see his daughter married
to a gentleman, and though he was sturdily
determined, if such a thing should ever happen,
to have her publicly acknowledged; yet would
he have disapproved of all the methods pursued
by his wife for forwarding such views,
had he been aware of them; nor did he permit
the slightest familiarity in his presence, from
the time that Betsy began to assume at all the
appearance of a woman. Indeed he often took
her seriously to task; and one memorable day,
in particular, as he sat before his house fire, he
drew his pipe, which he had been smoking for
some time in moody silence, from his mouth,
and addressed his daughter thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If thoo has a mind tle be a gintleman&rsquo;s
woife, or an honest man&rsquo;s outher, kep thee sell&rsquo;
to thee sell&rsquo;, and behave theesell&rsquo; decently.&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Turning half round, with both hands resting
on his knees, he seemed to measure her height
and form with his eyes, and then said, &ldquo;Thoo&rsquo;s
gitting up, Bess! dinna let the lads owr nigh
thee!&rdquo; She blushed and smiled. &ldquo;Coome,&rdquo;
he continued, &ldquo;thoo may kiss thee fayther
tho&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After a rough caress, he recommenced, still
looking at her, &ldquo;Thoo&rsquo;s a fine lass thoo! It
wad be a pity ti&mdash;a, that thoo shouldst coome
tle ney bitter end, than tle mac devartion for
scholar lads!&mdash;And sham to thee fayther!&rdquo; he
subjoined, after a pause, and in an altered tone.</p>

<p>After another pause he proceeded thus:&mdash;&ldquo;Bonny
devartion truly! bonny devartion!
Nay, nay, Betsy, thoo&rsquo;s worthy to be sum&rsquo;ot
bether nor that, my barne! If thoo sould
niver be a gintleman&rsquo;s woife, thoo may be a
farmer&rsquo;s woife, and ha&rsquo; plenty and decency roond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
thee aw thee days, and bonny bairns, like what
thoo was thee sell, aboot thee. And when I&rsquo;s
tired wee killing swine,&rdquo; he added, pleased with
the picture he had drawn, &ldquo;I can coome to
thee chimney corner, and tack the wee things on
my knee, and gee thee good-man sum&rsquo;ot be the
week for my leeving. I think I sould like that
bether, after aw Betsy, nor yon gentleman hunting!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A weel, fayther,&rdquo; said Betsy, affected,
&ldquo;and I&rsquo;ll dee whativer thoo wilt. Bit Mr.
Henry&rsquo;s a nice enough lad, tee&mdash;a! and civiler
grown nor he used to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel, weel, lass! Bit tack care o&rsquo; thee
sell: the civiler the war, may be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>That evening Henry brought one of his suppers
to be cooked; and, among other good
things, a jar of smuggled spirits, a delicacy
which he had latterly contrived, by some secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
means, to add to his feasts. On this occasion
he seemed already to have taken himself a
foretaste of the potent beverage. He found
Betsy unusually distant. He kept following
her about and deranging all her culinary proceedings,
in the hope of provoking a game
of romps. At last he got her up into a corner
and kept teasing her, and coming up so close
that it was impossible to get by without a
struggle, which was just what he wanted. At
this moment her father came in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kep off the lass!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;kep off the
lass!&rdquo; And, pushing Henry roughly aside, he
stood between him and his daughter. &ldquo;I tell
you what, Mr. Henry St. Aubin,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I
been&rsquo;t a gintleman, to be sure; bit she is my
flesh and blood for au&rsquo; that, and the best gintleman
in the land shan&rsquo;t coome nigh hand her,
withoot he gangs to church wee her first! She&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
a fine lass, and a bonny lass, and a good lass;
and worthy till be an honest man&rsquo;s wife, and
the mother o&rsquo; bonny bairns; and she sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be
sport for scholar lads, as long as her fayther has
twa hands tle knock him doon that mislests
her!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henry laughed coarsely, and muttered some
reply which did not seem to coincide exactly
with David&rsquo;s notions of delicacy; for he continued
thus:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hoo durst yee tle spack in that undecent
fashion afoor the lass? And what for do you
look at her e that gate?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henry, whose usually slender stock of good
manners had not received much addition from
his late intercourse with the spirit jar, was
getting provoked. He could think, at the moment,
of no readier mode of venting his anger
than that which the immediate power of insult<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>ing
offered. He seized Betsy, therefore, in pretended
jest, and began to pull her about rudely,
in open defiance of David and decency. The
father&rsquo;s ire, at this, so got the better of him,
that he forgot all his speculations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Git oot o&rsquo; my hoose!&rdquo; he cried; and seizing
Henry by the shoulders, he thrust him into the
street, flinging the preparations for the supper at
his heels, and exclaiming, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll gar ye! ye
greet gapping fiery-faced deevil! I&rsquo;ll gar ye!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henry&rsquo;s countenance, at the time, flushed
with intoxication, rage, and insolence, at once
suggested and justified the epithet of &lsquo;fiery-faced
deevil,&rsquo; bestowed by honest David.</p>

<p>The next time Henry found Betsy alone
(though, fortunately for her, her father came in
almost immediately) there was so much of
ferocity in his manner; and the determined advances
of the urchin, in despite of grave looks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
partook so much more of revenge than of love,
that Betsy was instinctively disgusted, and determined,
though with tears, to think no more
of him, and please fayther by marrying John
Dixon.</p>

<p>Dixon was a young farmer in the neighbourhood,
who could not help showing a partiality
for Betsy, though he did not much like her intimacy
with the scholar lads, nor the thoughts
of her having romped so often with Mr. Henry.
He got over all this, however, being a gentle-tempered,
kind-hearted, rather simple young
man; and, since he first fancied Betsy, disposed
to melancholy.</p>

<p>The day was accordingly fixed for their
wedding, when Henry, who had been forbid the
house, contrived, by the mother&rsquo;s means, to get
an interview with the bride elect. He affected
repentance for his late rudeness, pleaded exces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>sive
love by way of an excuse, and, rather than
be ousted by the farmer, proposed marriage.
Betsy shed tears of reconciliation, and poor
John Dixon was dismissed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> happened to be a young man at this
time expected in the village, who had received
his early education at S&mdash; B&mdash; school, and who
had been, for many years, the mate in mischief
of Henry St. Aubin.</p>

<p>The young man, of whom we are speaking,
was the only child of a lone woman who kept
the bakehouse of the village. His father,
whom he had never seen, had been, in the youthful
days of his mother, a scholar lad. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
mother was determined that her son should be,
as his father had been, a gentleman! She devoted,
therefore, the fruits of a life&rsquo;s industry to
educate him for the church. After such an
exertion, however, she had no pocket-money
left to give her darling, who, consequently, often
wanted cash. He was selfish, and had no principles.
His habits were low, yet, in their own
petty way, expensive. His present return to the
village was after a considerable absence. Henry
hastened to the bakehouse at the moment of his
arrival, and, taking him aside, asked him if
he was yet ordained, &ldquo;because,&rdquo; continued
Henry, without waiting for a reply, &ldquo;if you
are not, tell David you are, and pretend to
marry me to Betsy. We&rsquo;ll have rare fun and
carousing at the wedding: and the next time
my aunt fills my purse, I&rsquo;ll go halves with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>
<p>Now, the young man was in orders already;
but so good an offer as a carouse and even
half a purse, was not to be cast away without
consideration. Besides which, it might be
&lsquo;very convenient&rsquo; to have St. Aubin in his
power; for though it was perfectly well known
that Henry did not inherit any thing from his
father, his future prospects from his aunt were
equally well known not to be despicable; and,
at any rate, she behaved so handsomely to
him at present, that as a scholar-lad his purse
was always tolerably well lined; it was not
likely, therefore, that she would ever let him
be without money, when he went into the
world as a man. The conscientious young
divine, accordingly, without more time for his
calculations than whilst Henry spoke, told his
friend that he was not yet ordained, and, at the
same time, undertook that his mother should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
tell David (as well she might) that her son
was in orders. &ldquo;Indeed, for that matter,&rdquo; he
added, &ldquo;it will be the safest way to make her
think so herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After this, it was easily arranged, with all
parties, that Greyson (such was our hopeful
churchman&rsquo;s name) should perform the ceremony.
It was to take place among the roofless
ruins of S&mdash; B&mdash; Abbey, poor David having a
prejudice in favour of his child being married
in church, and the repaired part of the building,
which is the present church, being of
course locked. The little party, in contempt
of canonical hours, left David&rsquo;s house after
midnight. They passed down the street, and
all was silent. As they approached the little
bridge, situated half-way between the village
and the abbey, Betsy saw a man leaning over
the battlements, seemingly looking on the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
as it glided from beneath the one low arch.
She was sure, doubtful as was the light, for the
moon was much obscured, that the figure was
that of the young farmer. When they came to
the gate which divides the road and school-house
from the wide-spread ruins, they found it
fastened, and were obliged to get over the stile.
When elevated on the upper step of this, Betsy
gave one look towards the bridge. The figure
had left its position there. She passed her eye
along the road, and could still discern it following
at some distance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make haste!&rdquo; whispered Henry, hurrying
her down the steps rather roughly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re
not going to change your mind again, are
you?&rdquo; he added, sneeringly.</p>

<p>Betsy&rsquo;s heart misgave her, and she answered,
with a heavy sigh, &ldquo;If I have changed it ance,
Henry, it&rsquo;s no you &rsquo;at sould reproach me!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoot! if it is such a sighing matter,&rdquo; he
replied, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t break your heart to oblige
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tack care yee dinna brack it, Henry, nor
my honest fayther&rsquo;s nowther,&rdquo; was Betsy&rsquo;s
answer. Then, mentally she added, &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
ane &rsquo;at must be bracken, and that&rsquo;s enew.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment a shadow passed along a
moonlit wall beside them, and sunk in a dark
archway before them. They soon entered the
same archway; proceeded along the flags in
front of the great western entrance; mounted
some steps; walked on the northern high gravelled
terrace, some way; then, leaving it,
climbed over graves, and stumbled over tombstones,
till, descending a rugged path, among
nettles and long grass, they entered a part of
the ruin which was without any roof. The
walls, however, still rose to their full original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
height, till the starry sky seemed a canopy that
closed them in; while, through a row of long,
narrow, well-preserved arches, the moonlight
streamed with an adventitious brightness, borrowed
from contrast with the dark shadows in
every other part. The entrance of our party,
however, seemed the signal for all that had
been bright to disappear. The moon, which
had struggled for some time with the vapours
of a hazy night, almost at the instant dropped
behind a range of thick clouds near the horizon.
She set a few moments after, and the haze
thickening to a mizzling rain, the very stars
became extinguished. It was slowly, therefore,
and with difficulty, that the feet of our wanderers
now advanced to the further or eastern
end, where the altar is said to have once stood.</p>

<p>Our reverend divine here took a small dark
lantern from his breast, unfastened its door, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
opened before it a pocket prayer-book. By this
time the darkness of all around was total, and
added much to the strange effect of the partial
gleam that lit up the book, the one hand that
held it, and a part only of the one arm, the back
of the lantern itself throwing a powerful shadow
on the rest of the figure; so that the waving
hand seemed a floating vision unconnected with
any form, and the voice that arose out of the
darkness behind it, almost supernatural! At
the moment of its first sound, which, after the
silence that had preceded it, seemed to startle
every thing, an owl on the top of the ruins
screamed. Betsy shuddered: the owl fluttered
downwards, fell, as it happened, actually on the
lantern, and, striking it out of the hand that
held it, extinguished its light; then, having
panted a moment at the feet of the astounded
group, rose, and screaming again, brushed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
their faces. A minute after, its cry was heard
repeated, but fainter from the distance, for it
now came from the highest point of the steeple.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no to be, fayther!&rdquo; said Betsy, in a
low voice, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s no to be!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hoot!&rdquo; said Henry, gruffly.</p>

<p>Betsy felt her hand, on the other side, taken
in one that seemed to tremble. She thought,
at first, it was her father&rsquo;s; but just then she
heard his voice on the far side of Henry, saying
to the clergyman, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done noo?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He kens it off book,&rdquo; said Henry.</p>

<p>Greyson, who had engaged to swear whatever
Henry said, alleged that, while he held
the book in his hand, and repeated the words,
it was the same thing as if he read them. Accordingly,
with particular solemnity of tone,
as if to compensate for the want of other requisites,
he recommenced the ceremony.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>Betsy felt the hand suddenly dropped, which
had been all this time held against the throbbing
heart of some one, whose laboured breathing
she had distinguished close to her; not by
sounds, those were apparently suppressed, but
she had felt each warm sigh steal over that
side of her neck and cheek. A moment after
her hand had been dropped, she heard a slight
movement among some loose stones at a little
distance. The darkness was such, that she
could not see any of the figures present.</p>

<p>David gave away his daughter: the ceremony
was concluded, and they all began to
make the best of their rugged way homeward.
With much ado they got from among tombstones,
and fragments of ruins. They passed
the stile at the gate, even the bridge, and
Betsy could see no traces of any one; but it
was still very dark. At length they arrived at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
David Park&rsquo;s door; it was opened, and a
strong stream of light, pouring from it, crossed
the street. David, the clergyman, and a friend
of David&rsquo;s, who had been taken as a witness,
went in.</p>

<p>The bride and bridegroom, happening to be
a little behind the rest, were following, when,
just as Betsy put her foot on the threshold,
she heard in the direction of the bridge a
plunge, which, though distant, was distinct,
from the perfect stillness of the night. She
staggered back a few paces, drawing Henry
with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, run! run!&rdquo; she cried, pointing to the
bridge, which was in a straight line from where
they stood, so that any one who had been
upon it might have seen the light of David&rsquo;s
open door, and the figures entering.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Run where?&rdquo; asked Henry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yonder! yonder! Didna ye hear yon?
I&rsquo;s amaist sure its John, gane o&rsquo;ur the brig for
love o&rsquo; me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And if it be,&rdquo; replied Henry, &ldquo;he may
go. He shall have no help of mine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this tender and considerate speech from
the bridegroom, his young bride fainted away.
She was carried into the house, without any
one but Henry knowing the cause of her illness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My peur bairn&rsquo;s doon-hearted wid yon
darkling wedding, and that ne&rsquo;er do weel o&rsquo;a
Jenny Owlet,&rdquo; said David.</p>

<p>When Betsy recovered, which was not
for a considerable time, she told her father
her fears, and entreated him to go to the
bridge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was aw nonsense,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and no but
fancy! The lad had na mickle to say for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
sel, to be sure, bit he was no sic a feul as aw
that; and if there had been ony body faud i&rsquo;
the water, of a mischance, it wad be owr late
tle help them noo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, to satisfy his daughter, he walked
down the road; but returned, saying, he could
see nout. &ldquo;It was no but yon Jenny Owlet
again, or may be a wild duck; there plenty o&rsquo;
them i&rsquo; the Senbee vale. And, what&rsquo;s mare,&rdquo;
he added, &ldquo;I wadend care an&rsquo; we had twa on
them noo, twirling afoor this rouser.&rdquo;</p>

<p>So saying, he placed himself in his own large
chair before the said rouser, which he roused
still more, with a gigantic poker, as was his
invariable custom; while his wife laid on the
board smoking dishes, one of which was
graced, if not by two wild ducks, by two good
tame geese. Henry, mean time, was preparing,
scientifically, a large bowl of punch; to which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
was added, on the present occasion, several
bottles of choice wine, purloined from the
cellars of Lodore House.</p>

<p>In the morning, the miller who lives near to
where the river &mdash;&mdash;, after wandering through
the vale of S&mdash; B&mdash;, and passing under the
bridge of which we have spoken, empties itself
into the sea, found, stopped in its course, as it
floated towards the ocean, by his mill-dam, the
body of poor John Dixon. And Betsy was
long before she could get it out of her mind,
how his heart had beat against her hand so
short a time before it lay still, and cold, in the
mill-stream.</p>

With fear! Ah, they are dead!&rdquo;<br />

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lady</span> L. had not increased her family since the
birth of the twins, and they were, by this time,
between four and five years old. Her ladyship
now, however, expected to do so, and the event
was to take place at Lodore.</p>

<p>Dr. Dixon, too, such was the almost superstitious
confidence placed in him by Mrs. Montgomery,
was to be again employed, which was
matter of no small pride, as well as delight of
heart, to the good old man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not fail, as may be believed, to mention
in every house in Keswick, and that before
he felt a pulse, or even contemplated the hue
of a tongue, that an humble individual like
himself, had been selected to usher into this
eventful life the future Earl of L. &ldquo;For it
would be a boy, no doubt,&rdquo; ran on the Doctor,
&ldquo;as there are already two girls; lovely little
creatures!&mdash;the Ladies Julia and Frances L.
Both the future brides of noble earls, doubtless.
But, respecting the seniority of the Lady
Julia L.,&rdquo; continued the Doctor, proud of having
it in his power to give little people so much
information about great people, &ldquo;the circumstances
are very remarkable&mdash;very remarkable,
indeed! And if her little ladyship makes as
good use of her time through life, as she did
for the first three quarters of an hour, she will
be fortunate&mdash;very fortunate&mdash;no doubt of it!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Three quarters of an hour only, the elder of
her fair sister; yet, by that short space, is her
ladyship entitled to the sum of three thousand
pounds per annum; to which fine property,
situated in the shire of &mdash;&mdash;, her ladyship is,
by the will of the late Major Morven, of age
on the day that she completes her eighteenth
year. The property has on it, the Earl tells me,
a fine old family-seat, called the Craigs, with
wood, they say, worth forty thousand pounds!
The mansion, too, I understand, contains a
gallery of invaluable pictures, a fine library,
with service of plate, &amp;c.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old gentleman made a very curious will,
leaving the young lady entirely her own mistress,
independent of father, mother, or guardian.
&ldquo;For,&rdquo; said the good major, &ldquo;I had
not been an old bachelor, had they let me follow
my own way in my youth.&rdquo; &ldquo;I was one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
witnesses myself,&rdquo; continued the doctor, &ldquo;and
heard him say these words. The major was
gallant, you see, as all soldiers should be, and
was determined that his will, should not thwart
the will of a lady! The will! the will!
Well, come, that&rsquo;s very fair, a&rsquo;n&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>About this time, Mrs. Montgomery received
a letter from the master of the S&mdash; B&mdash; school,
stating, that he had been obliged, however reluctantly,
to expel Mr. St. Aubin from his establishment,
for the following offences, namely,&mdash;many
scandalous irregularities, respecting the
young women of the village; holding intercourse
with the crew of a smuggling vessel,
laying off S&mdash; B&mdash; head; absenting himself
for days and nights, it is supposed on board
the said vessel; and re-appearing in a shameful
state of intoxication.</p>

<p>Soon after this epistle had been read, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
before its contents had been half talked over,
Henry himself arrived. Some charges he denied,
others scoffed at; but did not succeed in
satisfying Mrs. Montgomery.</p>

<p>He was sitting with her and Lady L. in the
breakfast-room, which opens on the lawn.
Speaking in answer to the account of his being
supposed to have formed an unjustifiable intimacy,
at least, if not a marriage, with Betsy
Park, he said: &ldquo;You must know, ma&rsquo;am, the
people of that village are always getting some
one to swear that their daughters are married
to every gentleman&rsquo;s son in the school, just to
extort money. They consider it quite a trade,
I assure you,&rdquo; he added; seeing that what he
had said had made some impression. At this
moment, a tradesman-like looking man appeared
on the lawn.</p>

<p>On perceiving Henry, instead of directing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
his steps to the regular entrance, he came up
to the French window, or glass-door, which was
standing open. Stopping a moment, he said,
respectfully, to Mrs. Montgomery: &ldquo;May I
comeb ene, madam?&rdquo; His dress and manner
were so decent, and he seemed so much heated
and fatigued, that, without hesitation, she said:
&ldquo;Certainly, sir.&rdquo; He put the lifted foot, which
had waited in that position for her reply, over
the threshold, and, turning to Henry, said, in
a determined manner: &ldquo;Where is my Bess,
sir? Where is my bairn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t ask me,&rdquo; replied Henry, turning
pale, and speaking as though a lock-jaw were
coming on; &ldquo;the last I saw of her was in your
own house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, doon&rsquo;t say so, Mr. Henry!&rdquo; exclaimed
the poor man, clasping his hands entreatingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very true though,&rdquo; said Henry, gaining
courage.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not true!&rdquo; returned David, with sudden
fierceness, &ldquo;or, if it is,&rdquo; he added, changing
again to accents of despair; &ldquo;there&rsquo;s nay
body in this warld that kens whare she is!&rdquo;
He paused; then, with forced composure subjoined,
&ldquo;She gade oot o&rsquo; the hoose, the morn
after yee gade away, and she&rsquo;s niver cam back
syne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is gone off with some sweetheart, I
suppose,&rdquo; replied Henry, affecting carelessness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For sham o&rsquo; yeersel!&rdquo; cried David, &ldquo;for
sham o&rsquo; yeersel; and she at the doon-lying
wid yeer bairn! Wha was she gang wid bit
wid you? Ye ken weel enew, she was nane o&rsquo;
that sort, or ye wad niver have been forced til
mack her yeer wife.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s no wife of mine, man,&rdquo; interrupted
Henry, &ldquo;and don&rsquo;t dare to say so!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will dare,&rdquo; returned David, &ldquo;til spack
the truth.&rdquo; Henry switched his boots with his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
whip, and whistled a tune. David continued&mdash;&ldquo;She
is your wife, Mr. St. Aubin; and your
lawfu&rsquo; wife, afoor heaven, and lawfu&rsquo; witnesses
beside.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Neither you, nor your false witnesses, can
say that you saw us married,&rdquo; said Henry, with
a sort of laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we didna, we heard yee,&rdquo; replied poor
David.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then it would seem, by your own confession,
that you have nothing but hear-say to
found your story upon,&rdquo; wittily retorted master
Henry. &ldquo;You had better send the fellow away,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he added; turning, as he hurried out
of the room, to Mrs. Montgomery; who, together
with Lady L., had hitherto listened in
mute astonishment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look yee theere!&rdquo; cried David: &ldquo;oh,
madam, if my heart was na breaking within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
my body, I wad knock that young man doon at
my feet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Montgomery was about to speak, probably
to reprove such violence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hear me, madam!&rdquo; he continued with solemn
earnestness; &ldquo;Yee&rsquo;re a Christian woman,
and a mother, I dar say. She was doon-lying,
(as yon lady may be,) the neighbours aw kent
she was wid bairn, and kent she was wedded
and need na&rsquo; sham; then, whare wad she gang
from her fayther, and her fayther&rsquo;s hoose, in
sic a straight, if she didna gang we him, whose
wedded wife she was? Sweetheart, indeed!
An the lass had been withoot sham hersel,
whare&rsquo;s the sweetheart at wad tack her awa,
an she gone wid another man&rsquo;s bairn?&mdash;Not his
wife!&mdash;not his wife! An&rsquo; he thinks then, does
he, to tack a vantage of yon darkling wedding?
But I&rsquo;ll tell you aw aboot it, madam,&rdquo; he con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>tinued,
gasping for breath. Then, with the
utmost simplicity, he recounted every minute
particular of Betsy&rsquo;s wedding; the roofless ruin,
the midnight hour, the fall of the owl, the consequent
darkness, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and finding that his
relation was listened to with interest, and evident
compassion, he advanced a step nearer,
grasped Mrs. Montgomery&rsquo;s arm, with a hand
that almost scorched her skin, and, lowering
his voice, continued: &ldquo;Oh, madam! bit
what&rsquo;s to come, is war than all; I went to
Whiten like one distract, when Bess was missing;
and theere, the ostler folk at ane o&rsquo; the
Inn-yards, talt me sic a tale aboot a lady and
a gentleman, at had been seen late at evening,
walking ootby o&rsquo; the sands, a lang way aff.
And hoo the gentleman, at darkling, cam back
by his sel&rsquo;; and cam &rsquo;intle the inn-yard, looking
affeared like, and caw&rsquo;d for a carriage; and hoo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
he walked up and doon, up and doon, on a bit
o&rsquo; flag, nay longer nor yon table, aw the time
the cattle war putting too; (the folk showed me
the bit o&rsquo; flag;) and hoo, when ane on them asked
him to remember t&rsquo;ostler, hoo he looked at
him, and never spack; and when he asked him
again to remember t&rsquo;ostler, hoo he started like
a body at was wakened, and talt him te gang
te hell; and gave him nout, and bad the driver
drive on. I trembled fray head to foot,&rdquo; continued
David, &ldquo;and I asked them&mdash;but, oh, I
feard te hear what they should say in reply&mdash;I
asked them, if the lass was na wid bairn;
and&mdash;and&mdash;they answered&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; Here the poor
man became dreadfully agitated; threw up his
arms and eyes a moment, then flung himself
forward with violence on a table that stood before
him, laid his face down on it, and sobbed
audibly, uttering, in broken accents, the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>cluding
words:&mdash;&ldquo;They answered, she was
wid bairn&mdash;it was why they notished her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what would you infer?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Montgomery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wha wad it be but Bess!&rdquo; he replied,
still sobbing. &ldquo;And she did-na cam back,&rdquo; he
recommenced, raising his streaming eyes and
clasped hands to heaven, as he joined complaint
to complaint thus:&mdash;&ldquo;And she&rsquo;ll niver
cam back! and she was aw I had! and I&rsquo;ll
niver see her bonny face more! nor her bairn,
that I could ha&rsquo; loved for being Betsy&rsquo;s bairn,
if the deevil had been the fayther on&rsquo;t! He
has murdered her i&rsquo; the sands!&rdquo; he added,
sternly and suddenly, and he faced round as he
spoke, &ldquo;to be clean rid bathe o&rsquo; her and the
bairn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Silence! silence, man!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs.
Montgomery, in a voice of authority. Then,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
too much shocked and affected to experience,
in full, the indignation she must otherwise have
felt on hearing Henry thus accused, she added,
&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake compose yourself! The
horrible suspicion which agitates you in this
dreadful manner, it is quite impossible should
have any foundation! My nephew, however
imprudent he may have been, is much too
young a creature to have even thought of an
enormity such as this!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then where is Betsy?&rdquo; said the poor man,
looking up in her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shall insist on Henry&rsquo;s declaring all he
knows about her,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Montgomery.
&ldquo;Depend upon it, she is perfectly safe in some
lodging in Whitehaven, or some cottage in this
neighbourhood, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The poor father smiled. It was a ghastly
and a momentary smile. &ldquo;Heaven grant it!&rdquo;
he ejaculated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Henry has behaved most imprudently,&rdquo;
continued Mrs. Montgomery, &ldquo;in marrying, as
you assure me he has done: and very wickedly,
in endeavouring to deny it, when done; and I
shall see that he does your daughter, if she be
a modest girl, every justice, however ruinous
to his prospects, ill-fated being! But you
ought, indeed, my good man, you ought to take
care, how you accuse any one, lightly, of such
a crime as you have ventured to name! Were
it not that I see your own internal sufferings
are so dreadful, that you scarcely know what
you say, and that it all proceeds from parental
affection, in which I can sympathise, I should, indeed,
be very much, and very justly offended!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there was no severity in Mrs. Montgomery&rsquo;s
tone: she looked, while she spoke, at
her own daughter, and her mind glanced at
what was, and what was not, parallel in situa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>tion,
and she could have pardoned almost any
extravagance in poor David.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weel, weel,&rdquo; he replied, and forgetting
ceremony, he sat down on a chair, and leaned
back quite exhausted.</p>

<p>Lady L., who had felt for his extreme agitation,
and had ordered wine to be brought in,
now charitably offered him some, helping him
herself. At this mark of condescension he attempted
to stand up; but she saw he was
unable, and would not let him. He took the
glass from her; in doing so, a finger came in
contact with the hand of Lady L.; its touch
was like that of an icicle! He brought the
wine near his lips; then, pausing, laid it on the
table untasted, and said, &ldquo;Bit wha could yon
ha&rsquo; been, &rsquo;at went oot wid a young gintleman,
and niver cam&rsquo; back, and was big wid bairn!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo;   replied Mrs. Montgomery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
&ldquo;some lady, whose friends live in that direction,
and who had no intention of returning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>David took up the glass again; but it
dropped from his hand, and he fell to the floor
with a fatally heavy sound.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montgomery rang, called, begged
Lady L. to sit down quietly in the next room,
and not suffer herself to be agitated; then
rang, and called again. Servants appeared,
the doctor was sent for, bleeding, and every
other method of restoring animation, resorted
to, but in vain&mdash;poor David was no more! It
was the doctor&rsquo;s opinion, that his long and hurried
journeys on foot, the frightful agitation of
his mind, and the heat of the weather, had
all together occasioned apoplexy.</p>

<p>Henry, when, a few days after this melancholy
catastrophe, the subject was renewed,
persisted in his assertions, that he had never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
thought of marrying the girl; that she was a
perfectly good-for-nothing creature, and, most
probably, gone off with some fellow, whoever,
perhaps, she had been most intimate with;
though it was not a week since the father had
had the insolence to threaten him, because he
had spoken to the girl two or three times, with
legal proceedings, forsooth.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montgomery was staggered, and puzzled,
and knew not what to think. She wrote,
however, to the master of S&mdash; B&mdash; school, but
received, in reply, no more satisfactory information
than the certainty that Betsy Park was
missing. As to her character, she had always
been considered dressy, and fond of the company
of scholar lads.</p>

<p>If there was any truth in David&rsquo;s having
thought of taking legal proceedings, his sudden
death seemed to have silenced his intended wit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>nesses,
for no person came forward. All, therefore,
on which Mrs. Montgomery could decide
was, that Henry&rsquo;s profession should not be the
church, as had been intended; and that she
would settle some little pension on David Park&rsquo;s
widow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">A social</span> party of relatives, friends, and neighbours,
were seated round the dinner-table at
Lodore House. They have, it would seem,
just dispatched the first two courses, and all
important business thus concluded, they appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
to be, at the present moment, trifling most
agreeably with a summer dessert, consisting of
clustering grapes, golden pines, velvet-cheeked
peaches, &amp;c. &amp;c. These, crowning costly dishes,
and decked with fresh leaves and gay flowers,
resembled, as the shining surface of the board
reflected each inverted heap, so many isles of
plenty, scattered on a glassy sea. While, to
keep up our simile, we may add, that cruising
fleets of wine decanters sailed smoothly round
and round, dispensing, wherever they passed,
the sparkling juice of the foreign grape, with
wit and gaiety as sparkling. The busy hum
of voices still went on, some in the low murmur
of flirtation, some in the loud debate of politics;
while others, in medium tones, discussed
the merits of the last new novel, opera, or
play.</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson, who sat next to Mrs. Montgo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>mery,
addressing Henry, said&mdash;&ldquo;Pray, Mr.
St. Aubin, if the question is not an impertinent
one, who might the man be, whom I saw part
from you last evening, at the end of the wood
leading into the shrubbery walks between this
and my little place? I was much struck with
his figure, and the insolence, I had almost said,
of his step and carriage.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Henry, at first, affected not to hear; but, on
the question being repeated, answered, with
over-acted indifference&mdash;&ldquo;The fellow has been,
I believe, a sailor. Begging, I fancy, is his
present calling.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He doubted then,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Jackson,
&ldquo;either my ability, or my will to be charitable;
for he did not beg of me. Indeed, he seemed
disposed to get out of my way as fast as he
could.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Possibly,&rdquo; said Henry, &ldquo;he feared that,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
as a magistrate, you might put into force the
laws against vagrants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was something very remarkable in
the countenance of the man,&rdquo; persisted Mr.
Jackson: &ldquo;handsome, certainly; but the expression
sinister in the extreme!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Expression,&rdquo; repeated Henry with a sneer,
&ldquo;the man is deranged! You must have heard
of a mad beggar about Whitehaven, who calls
himself Sir Sydney Smyth: this is the fellow.
I have been foolish enough to give him money,
more than once, I believe; and, consequently,
he now does me the favour to consider me in the
light of an old acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; said Mr. Jackson, &ldquo;the man
spoke in a strangely loud and dictatorial tone.&mdash;And
so, he is a mad beggar! Well, I have
dignified him amazingly: for he presented to
my fancy, why, I scarcely know, the poetical
idea of Milton&rsquo;s devil, walking in paradise.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
The spot where I first observed him certainly
is equal to any garden of Eden I have ever
been able to imagine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The parson is always in the heroics!&rdquo; whispered
Lady Theodosia to her next neighbour,
Colonel B&mdash;: &ldquo;the last time I was down here,
he could talk of nothing but angels, I remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this moment, the beautiful little twins,
now between four and five years old, were
ushered in. After speaking to mamma, papa,
grandmamma, &amp;c. they took up their usual station,
one at each side of Edmund, who helped
them to fruit, ice, &amp;c. Indeed he had so many
requisitions of attention from both young ladies,
and generally at one and the same moment, that
he proved himself to have no mean talent for
gallantry, in being able to turn with sufficient
quickness from one to the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, my little pupil will learn to be quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
an accomplished ladies&rsquo; man,&rdquo; observed Mr.
Jackson, aside to Mrs. Montgomery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then will the list of his accomplishments be
complete!&rdquo; said our old friend the doctor, who
happened to catch the words, though across the
table; &ldquo;for I understand you are teaching him
everything&mdash;absolutely everything! In short,
erecting, on the substratum of ancient literature,
an elegant structure, adorned with all the modern
additions lately made to science, and
inhabited by the muses!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Mr. Jackson, who always answered
seriously, however foolish the speech
addressed to him; &ldquo;I could not feel satisfied in
communicating to a mind like Edmund&rsquo;s, mere
dry learning: he already shows a sensibility to
what I call the poetry of nature, and indeed of
everything, which quite delights me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A young lady, beside whom Henry sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
speaking at the same time to her neighbour,
observed, that the little beau had quite enough
to do. &ldquo;It is not every gentleman who can
take as good care of even one lady,&rdquo; she added,
with a laugh.</p>

<p>Henry&rsquo;s attention thus aroused, (for something
had thrown him into a reverie,) he
perceived that the lady&rsquo;s plate was quite vacant.
He started, apologized, and now heaped
upon it every kind of fruit; making, at the
same time, so many pretty speeches, that
the young lady began to suspect that love,
and that for herself, must have caused his absence
of manner. Henry now appeared determined
to be quite gay, and even full of frolic:
and the young lady, restored to perfect good-humour,
seemed highly amused by his efforts.</p>

<p>Edmund, and his two little ladies, were on the
other side of Henry; Julia the nearest to him:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
whenever she looked away, he stole the fruit off
her plate; and laughed much, in unison with
his young lady, at her look of innocent astonishment,
when she turned about; and at her
instant application to Edmund, to get her more
fruit; which, at the next opportunity, Henry
would again steal. At length he was discovered;
and Julia, without condescending to remonstrate,
turned her shoulder as much as possible
to him, and took better care of her plate; which
she pushed with both hands quite close to
Edmund&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Henry&rsquo;s young lady, now seized with a
strong veneration for justice, insisted on her
swain&rsquo;s making restitution of the heap of
fruit, by this time collected before her. He,
accordingly, slipped his hand over Julia&rsquo;s head,
and emptied the young lady&rsquo;s plate on hers.
Julia turned round; hustled back from off her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
own chair, and on to Edmund&rsquo;s knee, supporting
herself with one arm over his shoulder;
and now, facing the enemy, she took up her
plate in her other hand, slid off its whole contents
on the table near Henry, still without
speaking to him, and asked Edmund to give
her more fruit; which he did.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is not polite, my dear,&rdquo; observed
Lady L.; &ldquo;why should you throw Henry&rsquo;s
fruit away, and take the same kind from
Edmund?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; answered Julia, speaking distinctly,
and with an air of importance and
decision which amused every one, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
love Henry, and I do love Edmund!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Explicit, upon my word!&rdquo; said a gentleman
at the other side of the table, who had been all
day receiving alternate smiles and frowns from
an heiress, to whom he was paying his devotions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You love poor Henry, then, I suppose,&rdquo;
said that gentleman&rsquo;s fair neighbour to Frances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, indeed!&rdquo; said Frances; &ldquo;I hate
Henry!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And so do I!&rdquo; said Julia.</p>

<p>The twins always made it a point to be exactly
of the same opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must not hate any one, my dears,&rdquo;
said Lady L., looking grave.</p>

<p>Frances was busily engaged arranging the
grey hair of the doctor; and the better to effect
her purpose, she was standing on tip-toe on the
seat of her chair, with her little arms stretched
eagerly across the wrinkled, smiling countenance
of the good old man. While Julia, having kept
the strong position she had at first taken up on
Edmund&rsquo;s knee, was sitting perfectly still.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How marked at this moment,&rdquo; observed
Mr. Jackson, aside to Mrs. Montgomery, &ldquo;are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
the distinguishing characteristics of the two
little girls! Quiescent,&rdquo; he proceeded, &ldquo;I
should hardly know one from the other: the
size, the fairness of the skin, the brilliancy of
the red in the cheek, but especially the remarkable
quantity of curling, floating, flaxen
hair, is so exactly the same in both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The eyes,&rdquo; interrupted Mrs. Montgomery,
&ldquo;are a different colour.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; and in my opinion,&rdquo; said Mr.
Jackson, &ldquo;the dark hazel is the most beautiful
eye in the world! Yet, Frances&rsquo;, it must be
owned, have many of the poets on their side.
Do look,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;at the elastic spring of
all her movements, and the picturesque air of
her every attitude; while Julia&rsquo;s grace is
always that of repose, except at the moment of
some immediate excitement&mdash;I mean, of the
feelings, when the colour mounts, the eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
sparkle, and all becomes energetic expression.
That little creature will require the greatest
nicety of management: her very warmth of
heart may lead to a too great vehemence of
character.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has certainly a most affectionate disposition,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Montgomery.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And her gratitude,&rdquo; pursued Mr. Jackson,
&ldquo;is quite a passion!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, gratitude can never degenerate into
a fault!&rdquo; resumed Mrs. Montgomery, &ldquo;and
the child is not in the least selfish; indeed, it
is always in the cause of something oppressed
or injured, that her little spirit rises: a bird,
a fly, or I have seen her, after trying to beat
Henry, sit down and cry over a crushed worm,
that he had refused to step aside to spare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She may require the stricter guard,&rdquo; rejoined
Mr. Jackson; &ldquo;for, under the guise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
and in the cause of generous feelings, we sometimes
permit a warmth of temper to grow upon
us, which we should have early subdued, had it
appeared with a bare-faced front, and offered
to fight our own battles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The rising of the ladies to retire, here put an
end to the conversation.</p>

<p>In a day or two, Lady L.&rsquo;s expected confinement
took place. What were the rejoicings,
bonfires, and illuminations, may be imagined,
when we say, that the child was, as the doctor
had prophesied, a son.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 4em;">&ldquo;Thinkest thou, that he but sleeps?</span><br />
Long shalt thou wait his awaking.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> sick nurse ought not to have been asleep.
Yet it appears that she certainly must have
slept; for when the sound of something like
a door shutting made her start forward from
the deep, high back, of her easy-chair, she
found, not only that her eyes had been shut,
but that she had dreamed, what she considered
a most remarkable dream. She was our old acquaintance
from Edinburgh, and was very superstitious.
The dream, and the particulars at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>tending
it, were as follows. We shall give
them in her own words, as she ventured, nearly
thirteen years after, to relate them, under a
promise of secrecy, to her countrywoman, Mrs.
Smyth, while they sat together at their tea
in the housekeeper&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The peur lady,&rdquo; said the nurse, &ldquo;had
fall&rsquo;n intle a sweet sleep, wi&rsquo; the baby at her
breast. The chamber was dark, exceptin&rsquo; a
dull bit lamp, that was blinking doon on the
hearth-stane; for being summer time, there
was nae fire. I mysell&rsquo; was sitting quietly e
the great chair; every thing e the hoose was se
still, that I amaste thought &rsquo;at I could hear the
far-aff voises o&rsquo; the folk, &rsquo;at was making rejoicing
around the bonfires. My ane mind,
you see, being quite easy like; for, nor mother,
nor child, could be doing better nor they were
doing; I must just ha&rsquo; dozed a bit; for I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
begun a-dreaming, tho&rsquo; I canna&rsquo; say precisely
the purport of my dreams, until I thought I
saw Mr. Henry, as plain as I see you, slip on
tip-toe, and stop half-way e the middle e the
floor. And then, I was se parfect certain, that
I heard him ask, in a whisper, hoo Lady L.
was; that I meant to reply, &lsquo;As weel as can
be expected, Sir;&rsquo; bit tho&rsquo; I begun working
my jaw frae side to side, to strive to get the
words oot, it was se stiff it wad na move. I
can remember naething maer, till I thought I
heard a soond like a watchman&rsquo;s rattle; and
then, I thought it was naething bit the crumpling
o&rsquo; a piece o&rsquo; paper, &rsquo;at I dreamed the
doctor was taking aff o&rsquo; a bottle o&rsquo; medicine.
I was sure &rsquo;at I saw him quite plain, standing
wi&rsquo; the bottle in his hand, near the table. Nor
was I that far gane, but that I kent weel
enough, through aw my sleep, &rsquo;at I ought tle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
rise and reach him a glass; bit I had na poor
tle stir a limb. I could nae ha&rsquo; been weell
mysell&rsquo;, for it was mere like tle a trance, woman,
nor tle common sleep. And then, I
thought, &rsquo;at to my great surprise, the doctor
had the vara face o&rsquo; Mr. Henry, bit oulder like;
and while I was wondering at this, and looking
at the doctor, and the doctor, I thought, looking
hard at me, the doctor, and the bottle, and
the table, and the foot o&rsquo; the bed-curtain, aw
disappeared; and I can remember naething
mere, bit a deal o&rsquo; confusion about being hame
again in Edinburgh; until I was wakened
ootright, by what I thought at the time, was
the shutting o&rsquo; the door frae the dressing-room
intle the gareden. Bit it must ha&rsquo; been the
doctor&rsquo;s rap, for he cam&rsquo; in amaste immediately.
What was vara remarkable was, that after I
should ha&rsquo; dreamed o&rsquo; seeing yon bottle in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
doctor&rsquo;s hand, that there should hae been se
mickle said and done about yon vara bottle;
and that it should ha&rsquo; been yon bottle, that I
mysell&rsquo; blamed for every thing! Weel! the
doctor he could na get the bit tie undoone; and
he sais to me, &lsquo;Mrs. Mowbray, will you favour
me weth a pin?&rsquo; I remember it as weel as
it was but yesterday. And he said, at the
same time, that he never had afore, in aw the
hale course o&rsquo; his practice, used a double knot
wi&rsquo; tying down a bottle, but a&rsquo;y a single ane,
wi&rsquo; the ends twisted. And then he said, in his
curious way, ye ken, as he shook the bottle afoor
he poured the medicine intle the glass, that the
good lady need na to be afeared to tack it, for
that he aye mixed his medicines afoor dinner.
And then, he pleased his sell&rsquo;, honest man, wi&rsquo;
laughing a bit at his ane joke. And then he
geed the lady the glass; bit yeer mistress, wha<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
had come in soon after the doctor did, and wha
was standing at the bedside, just eased the lily-white
hand o&rsquo; the weight, for a moment or twa,
while she observed, that as her daughter had
had some refreshing sleep, it might no be necessary
to gie her a composing draught. Weel,
the doctor, he alood his sell&rsquo;, that there was
naething like natural rest; bit tho&rsquo; he was
amang the best o&rsquo; them, he was like them aw,
in that particular, he wad hae his ane ill-savoured
trash swallowed, right or wrong&mdash;and
wrong enough it proved. However, the doctor
said, that they might depend upon it, it was a
maste benign and salubrious mixture; and that
having slept se much a&rsquo;ready, the lady might
the mere likely be wakefu&rsquo; in the night-time, if
she did na tack her sleeping-draught. And se,
her peur mither, she was over-ruled, and geed
her back the glass. And she swallowed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
draught sure enough, and slept sure enough,
and lang enough, for she never waked more!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Smyth made no reply, for she was rocking
herself from side to side, with the tears rolling
down her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The doctor, peur old man, he is dead and
gane,&rdquo; resumed the nurse, &ldquo;or I wad na say
what I am going to say, even to yoursell&rsquo;, Mrs.
Smyth; but I have often thought syne,&rdquo; and
here she lowered her voice, &ldquo;that yon sleeping-draught
was stronger nor the hold o&rsquo; life in her
that drank it.&rdquo; Mrs. Smyth only shook her
head. &ldquo;My dream,&rdquo; added the old nurse, after
a short silence, &ldquo;certainly cam&rsquo; oot, about the
bottle; and that&rsquo;s what I blame mysell&rsquo; for:
I should ha&rsquo; spoken up, and talt the vision; for
never did I, nor ony belanging to me, dream o&rsquo;
seeing ony thing, so distinct as I saw yon bottle,
that some harm did na come o&rsquo; &rsquo;t. And the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
doctor, too, he was na long for this warld, after
I dreamed o&rsquo; seeing his face changed. It&rsquo;s
never good to dream o&rsquo; seeing ony body wi&rsquo;
another body&rsquo;s face.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bonfires, indeed!&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Smyth
to herself, as if thinking aloud. &ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; she
added, in a spiritless tone, when aroused to
attention by the ceasing of nurse&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;it
was a particular dream, to be sure. And some
of the folk was saying, too, that there was ane
seen oot by that night, that keeped be his sell&rsquo;,
like the angel o&rsquo; death. He went near nowther
bonfires nor drink, and was seen ne more, when
aw was over wi&rsquo; them within.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He lies beside the dead; at frantic starts,<br />
Kisses the cold lips of Julius.&rdquo;<br />
<br />
&ldquo;At such a moment, piety becomes<br />
The only passion of the soul!&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Although</span> the conversation related in our
last chapter, was not, as we have already
hinted, held between the parties till thirteen
years after the present era, owing to the nurse&rsquo;s
unwillingness to confess that she had slept when
she should have watched; yet, as the subjects
of which it treats, belong strictly to this epoch
of our history, we do not consider that we an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>ticipate
unjustifiably, in giving the conversation
itself the place it now fills.</p>

<p>The melancholy events to which it alludes,
divested only of the additions made by superstition,
did indeed but too truly, too surely,
take place at this period. Lady L.&rsquo;s infant
died at her breast, soon after the closing in of
evening had rendered the illuminations for its
birth conspicuous; and in less than half an
hour she herself expired.</p>

<p>When once the termination of the miserable
scene had separated the remaining members
of the family, Lord L. could not be prevailed
on to see again, even for a moment, Mrs.
Montgomery or the children. He lay, day
and night, without retiring, on the sofa in
his dressing-room, till the funeral was over,
and then fled to the continent in a state of
mind the most alarming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>Henry, now destined to a naval life, went
with him as far as the port where both embarked,
though on board different vessels.</p>

<p>Henry, usually so unamiable, had, on the
present occasion, greatly endeared himself both
to Mrs. Montgomery and Lord L. by the excessive
grief he had evinced. Indeed, his
countenance appeared haggard, and expressive
not only of sorrow, but almost of despair.</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson was the only person who had
conducted any thing like business; not only
the family, but the very servants, were in consternation;
and even the doctor had been quite
unable to give the slightest assistance. He,
indeed, from the time that Lady L.&rsquo;s unfavourable
symptoms had appeared, had behaved
as if seized with sudden insanity; while life
remained, he had continued in the sick room, in
a state of uncontrollable perturbation; he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
drained or tasted every bottle from which the
patient had taken medicine; his hand had trembled
to that degree, that he had broken almost
every thing he had attempted to take up; he
had repeated incessantly the word &ldquo;No, no, no,&rdquo;
beginning with low murmurs, and increasing
gradually in quickness and loudness, and again
declining into whispers; till, finally, the moment
Lady L. had expired, he rushed from the
house without hat or cane, and ran till he
reached home, while his horse stood in the
stables at Lodore.</p>

<p>It was Mr. Jackson too, who had put all the
household in mourning, and who had made the
arrangements for the funeral: at which, what
was remarkable, was the concourse of the poor,
and, perhaps, the unpremeditated part taken by
our hero in the solemn pageant; for, when the
hearse arrived at its destination, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
body was about to be lifted out, poor Edmund,
to the astonishment of every one, was discovered
lying across the coffin. He had not
fainted; for, when brought into the light, he
looked all round him vacantly, and, with a
sudden movement, hid his face again.</p>

<p>Mrs. Smyth had, it seems, some days before
shown him the chamber of death, with all its
awful circumstances; and on this morning,
when dressing him, she had, inconsiderately,
given vent to the petulance which often accompanies
sorrow, in the following words:&mdash;&ldquo;And
its her ain sel &rsquo;at brought ye in aff the cald
stanes, boy, and tak the wet rags aff ye, and
put the warm clothing on ye, and geed ye
bread when ye were hungry, boy; its hersel&rsquo;
they&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to carry oot the day, and leave her
by hersel&rsquo;, in the cald church-yard!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edmund made no reply; but soon after this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
he stole from the nursery, and lingered about
the halls. Presently the bearers brought out
the coffin; he followed at their feet, and when
they lifted it into the hearse, he too clambered
up unheeded. But here, no sooner was the
hearse closed, and the consequent darkness complete,
than the situation into which an impulse
of grateful affection had led the poor child,
proved too much for his strength. A strange
sensation of awe, and worse than loneliness,
at once silenced the sobs which had hitherto
shaken his frame; the tears, which had been
streaming over his cheeks, ceased to flow; his
forehead became covered with the cold dew of
superstitious terror; he was motionless; his
very breathing was suspended; while still the
wretched consciousness remained, that his little
heart was breaking. And had the funeral not
arrived at the church door at the moment it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
did, most probably either life or reason must
have yielded to a combination of feelings so
overwhelming.</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson also preached the funeral sermon.
All he was able to deliver were a few
broken sentences of passionate admiration and
pathetic regret, mingled with the tender hopes
of piety, for the triumphant ones he could not
reach.</p>

<p>And now it was painful to witness, even on
the outside, the appearance of the late gay
Lodore House. All was silent; the very bells
were taken off the necks of the sheep that fed
on the lawn; no sound was heard, but the uninterrupted
murmur of the fall; every window
was closed by a blind or shutter; and when
any symptom of remaining life was seen, it
was, at times, the figure of Mr. Jackson, in
deep mourning, both of habit and attitude,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
leaning against the paling, and looking fixedly
at the two little girls, in their little black
frocks, walking, one on each side of Edmund,
also dressed in black, up and down the gravel
before the door, without speaking a word, or
deviating from the direct path. If a meal of
the children happened to be ready, Mrs. Smyth
would come to the door, and preserving silence,
beckon them in; then letting them pass her, and
following them, look at them, and shake her
head mournfully.</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>
&ldquo;Am I indeed the cause of this?&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> one of the streets of Keswick stood an old,
gloomy, but respectable house. In this house
was a small back parlour, receiving light from
a back lane, and surrounded with shelves, covered
with bottles and jars; while ranged beneath
the shelves were small drawers, on the
outsides of which appeared, labelled, the names
of every medicine in use. In the midst of
this parlour stood a table; on the table stood
a number of bottles, with the apparatus for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
various chemical experiments; and before the
table, wrapped in a loose dressing-gown, slippers
on his feet, his grey hair uncombed, stood
Doctor Dixon. On his face a haggard expression
of fear, inverted the lines of harmless
mirth which had so often mingled, gleefully,
with those of age, on the poor man&rsquo;s features.
His step was uncertain, and his hand trembled,
as he selected another and another bottle from
a shelf, or another paper from a drawer. His
whole frame seemed to have undergone a species
of dissolution; and all the infirmities of old
age, which he had hitherto, with so much
gaiety, warded off, seemed to have been suddenly
let in upon him. In short, his heart was
broken!</p>

<p>A terrible suspicion had for some days
pressed upon his mind; his experiments, his
researches, had failed to throw any light upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
the subject; he had not dared to communicate
his thoughts to any one. He sat down. At
length he exclaimed, &ldquo;I&mdash;I, who should have
healed, have I destroyed?&rdquo; Tears came to
his relief. &ldquo;I am an old man,&rdquo; he said, in a
faltering tone, &ldquo;I cannot live long: would I had
died before this had happened!&rdquo; After a long
silence, during which he moved his lips often,
and seemed to undergo a powerful inward
struggle, he pronounced, with the air of one
refusing an importunate request, &ldquo;Never!
never! never!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The cruel thoughts which so agonized the
poor man&rsquo;s mind were these. From Lady L.&rsquo;s
symptoms, he suspected that her death had
been occasioned by poison; every medicine
she had taken had been mixed by himself, and
here was the distracting thought! Some ingredients
in his dispensary must then, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
feared, have come to him wrong labelled; and,
in mixing these, he must have formed some
combination, hitherto unknown in chemistry,
which had produced a deadly poison. To decide
this point, he made numerous experiments.
When every mixture proved wholesome,
or at least innocent, and every label
seemed rightly placed, he would say to himself.
&ldquo;But, they are dead!&rdquo; Then, after pausing,
and wearying his mind with vain conjectures,
he would break forth again: &ldquo;And the symptoms
of both were those of poison, which the
babe, doubtless, imbibed with its mother&rsquo;s milk.
And I mixed every medicine myself; my own
servant took them over; they lay on the table
in Lady L.&rsquo;s own bedroom, till I, with my own
hands, administered them, taking care to see
that my own labels were upon them! Yet,&rdquo;
he added, shuddering, &ldquo;the dregs in one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
bottles had neither exactly the colour, nor exactly
the taste, that I should have anticipated.&rdquo;
And whenever this conviction forced itself upon
him, he turned cold, and the pulsations of his
heart ceased for some seconds.</p>

<p>We have seen the doctor completing the last
of his experiments. He had reflected for a short
time, in dreadful agitation, whether he were
not in duty bound to declare his belief respecting
the cause of Lady L.&rsquo;s death to the family.
He had decided that the information could only
add to their affliction; while the confession, to
himself, would be worse than ten thousand
deaths! It was at this conclusion he had
arrived, when we heard him exclaim, &ldquo;Never!
never! never!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He destroyed the whole contents of his dispensary,
never more prescribed for any one, or
mixed another medicine. All observed a gene<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>ral
decay, a total failure both of strength and
faculties, in their friend, the good doctor. He
never smiled again, nor made another pun; and
in a few weeks he died, carrying with him to
the grave, the dreadful secret, or rather surmise,
which was the occasion of his death.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He spoke of thee, but not by name.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">About</span> six months after the death of Lady L.,
Mrs. Montgomery, in looking over papers of all
descriptions, which had accumulated on her
dressing-table, while she had been unable to
attend to any thing, found one, folded and
wafered, which had the appearance of a petition.
On being opened, however, it proved to
be a sort of letter, but vulgarly written, badly
spelt, and without signature. It was also
without date of time or place. It bore, not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>withstanding,
in its simplicity, strong marks of
truth.</p>

<p>It professed to be from a person, calling
herself Edmund&rsquo;s nurse. Yet it gave him no
name but that of the &ldquo;young masther; or,
be rights, the young lord, sure; only he was
too young, the crathur, to be calling him
any thing, barring the misthress&rsquo;s child.&rdquo; In
like manner, it called Edmund&rsquo;s father &ldquo;the
lord,&rdquo; and his mother &ldquo;the lady,&rdquo; but did
not mention the title of the family. The writer
asserted, that having laid the child down for
a moment, on the grass of the lawn, at a time
when the family were from home, it was stolen
by a strolling beggar, for the sake of the fine
clothes it had on; for, that the &ldquo;lord and
the lady&rdquo; were, that very day, expected at the
castle. That afraid of blame, she had substituted
her own infant.   That it had been re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>ceived
without suspicion by the parents, who,
having been &ldquo;mostly in London town and
other foreign parts,&rdquo; had seen but little of their
boy. It then went on as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;A little
while after, sure, I seen the poor child, with
hardly a tack on him, of a winter&rsquo;s day, in the
arms of the divil&rsquo;s own wife, at laste, if it was&rsquo;nt
the divil himself, the strolling woman, I mane,
in the big town, hard by. I went up to her,
and abused her all to nothing, and offered
to take the child from her. And glad enough
he was, the crathur, to see me, and stretched
out his poor arms to come to me. But the
woman, she hits him a thump, and houlds down
both his little hands with one of her great big
fists, and turns to me, and says, smelling strong
wid spirits all the while, (but for a drunkard
as she was, she had cunning enough left,) and
she says, spakin&rsquo; low, and winking her eye,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
like, &lsquo;And whose young master is that,
dressed up at the castle, yonder?&rsquo; says she.
&lsquo;And it&rsquo;s my boy, to be sure,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;and
small blame to me, when you didn&rsquo;t lave me
the right one.&rsquo; &lsquo;And are you going to send
the right one there now, if you get him?&rsquo; says
she. &lsquo;And what&rsquo;s that to you?&rsquo; says I. And
with that, she gives a whistle like, and snaps
her fingers afore my face, and thrusts her
tongue in her cheek, and begins jogging off.
&lsquo;And&rsquo; says I, following of her, &lsquo;and what do
you want o&rsquo; the child?&rsquo; says I; &lsquo;and haven&rsquo;t
you got the clothes? and can&rsquo;t yee be satisfied?
I&rsquo;m not going, sure, to ax them of yee, and
can&rsquo;t yee give me the child! when it&rsquo;s I that
&rsquo;ill kape him warm, any how, and fade him well
too; I that gave him the strame o&rsquo; life from my
own breast,&rsquo; says I; &lsquo;and what &rsquo;ud I be grudging
of him afther that?&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;Then nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
at all sure, but jist what belongs to him!&rsquo; says
she, &lsquo;But the divil a bit of him you&rsquo;ll get, any
how; for there&rsquo;s not a day since I&rsquo;ve carried
him, that I haven&rsquo;t got the price of a dram, at
laste, by the pitiful face of him!&rsquo; says she.
&lsquo;And for that mather,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;if any one
takes him to the castle,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;it&rsquo;ll be myself
that&rsquo;ll do it,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;and git the reward
too.&rsquo; &lsquo;You the reward!&rsquo; says I; &lsquo;is it for
stailing him? It&rsquo;s the gaol&rsquo;s the reward you&rsquo;ll
get, my madam!&rsquo; says I. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the resaver&rsquo;s
as bad as the thafe,&rsquo; says she. &lsquo;And it&rsquo;s you,
and yours, that&rsquo;ll git more by the job than
iver I will. But it&rsquo;s I that&rsquo;ll make my young
gintleman up at the castle yonder, pay for his
sate in the coach, and his sate in the parler,
too, one o&rsquo; these days,&rsquo; says she, wagging her
head, and looking cunning like. And so it
was, to make a long story short, the divil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
tempted me; and I couldn&rsquo;t think te take my
own boy out o&rsquo; the snug birth he had got safe
into; and the divil a bit o&rsquo; her &rsquo;at was worse
nor the divil, that &rsquo;ud give up the mistress&rsquo;s
boy quietly, at all, at all; and so, I was
forced, without I&rsquo;d a mind to tell the whole
truth, to say no more why about it, and let
her take the poor child away wid her, tho&rsquo;
my heart bled for him. Well, sure, twis
every year, she came to the big town, begging,
and brought him with her, sure enough; but
looking miserable like, and starved like; for
it was less of him there was every time, instead
o&rsquo; more. And be the time he was near
hand five years ould, she brought him, at last,
sure, lainin&rsquo; up on crutches, and only one leg
on him! I flewd upon her like a tiger, to be
sure, and just fastening every nail o&rsquo; me in the
face of her, I axed her where the rest o&rsquo; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
boy was. And she tould me, but not till she
was tired bateing me for what my nails had
done, that the leg o&rsquo; him was safe enough in
the bag. And a dirty rag of a bag there was,
sure enough, hanging where the tother leg
should be. And jist then, cums by the
coach and six from the castle! And up
she makes to the side of it, with the brazen
face of her, driving the poor cripple before
her. And, sure, I see my mistress throw
money out to him, little thinking it was her
own child, with the one bare foot of him over
the instip in mud, and them crutches, pushing
his little shoulders a&rsquo;most as high as his head,
and his poor teeth chattering with the could,
and the tears streaming from his eyes, (for
she&rsquo;d given him a divil of a pinch, to make
him look pitiful.) And there was my boy
sitting laughing on the mistress&rsquo;s knee. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
he looked quite sorry like, when the little
cripple said he was hungry, and he throw&rsquo;d
him out a cake he was ateing. &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; says
I, (quite low to myself,) &lsquo;that you should be
throwing a mouthful of bread to the mistress&rsquo;s
child!&rsquo; And it was for dropping on my knees
I was, and telling all, to the mistress herself;
but just then, they brought her out a sight o&rsquo;
toys she was waiting for, and she drawd up the
winder, and the coach druv off. And the next
time the woman cum, she cum&rsquo;d without him,
at all, at all! &lsquo;And,&rsquo; says I, &lsquo;the last time
you cum&rsquo;d, you brought but a piece of him,
and now you&rsquo;ve brought none at all of him!&rsquo;
But she tould me, sure, his fortune was made,
and that he was with grand people that &rsquo;ud do
for him. But I wouldn&rsquo;t believe her, you see,
and gave her no pace, any way, but threat&rsquo;nin&rsquo;
te hav&rsquo; her hanged at the &rsquo;sizes, if I was hanged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
myself along with her, till she took&rsquo;d my husband
with her over seas, and let him see the
boy. And he seen him, sure enough, walking
with a nice ould lady, that&rsquo;s been your
ladyship, I suppose. And he had his two legs,
my husband said, which I was particular glad
to hear. And he was getting fat, too, and
rosy-like, and was dressed, as the mistress&rsquo;s
child (heaven love the boy) should be. And
this made my mind a dale asier, for now there
was little wrong dun him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, by and bye, troubles came upon me,
and my husband died; but, before he died, he
thought, and I thought about our sin in regard
to the child, and so I made him write down
the way to get a letter to your ladyship&rsquo;s hands;
and it was a thing that my husband, as he
was a dying, seemed to hear to. Well,
when I buried my husband, sure, I fell sick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
myself, and then I begun to think the hand of
Heaven was upon me, and I sat up in my bed,
and wrote this long letter to your ladyship;
which, becourse of what my husband set down
for me before he died, I give to one that&rsquo;s going
over seas to the harvest, to give to your ladyship&rsquo;s
own hand. He&rsquo;ll tell your ladyship
all my husband thought it best not to put
down in the letter. But just ax him that takes
it what is nurse&rsquo;s name, and he&rsquo;ll tell you fast
enough, and all about the great folk at the
castle. And it&rsquo;s he that can tell that too, for
its he that ought to know it, for his father, and
grandfather before him, got bread under them,
and he might have got bread under them
himself, only for his tricks. But no matter for
that. He knows no more o&rsquo; what&rsquo;s inside the
letter, than one that never seen the outside of
it; and he&rsquo;s sworn too, before the praist, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
the bedside of the sick, and may be of the
dying, to deliver it safe, for the ase of the conscience
of the living, and the rest of the soul of
him that&rsquo;s dead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And now I have no more to add, but that
the young masther (that&rsquo;s him that&rsquo;s with your
ladyship this present time,) when he has all,
should take it to heart to do for his foster-brother,
that&rsquo;s innocent of all harm, and that
has larned to lie on a soft bed, without fault o&rsquo;
his, and that throwd him the cake he was aiting
in the coach, poor boy, when he thought it was
his own, and that may be too.&mdash;But no matter
for that now: the penance has been done for
that, and the absolution has been given for
that, and the priest has had his dues.   And it&rsquo;s
not like the sin that satisfaction can be done
for, and that it must be done for too, before the
absolution can serve the soul: sich as giving back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
to the owner his own, or the likes of that; or
the setting up of the misthress&rsquo;s child again in
his own place, and the pulling down of him
that a mother&rsquo;s heart blades for, but that has
no business where he is; though it would be
hard, for all that, if his father&rsquo;s child should
want. But don&rsquo;t be frightening yourself with
the thoughts of that, Molly. The young masther,
after all that cum and gone, will surely do
for him that&rsquo;s his foster-brother, any way; and
may be do something for his foster-sister too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why I trouble your ladyship I forgot to
mintion, but thim that it concarns most are not
to the fore, and, besides, you have the boy.&mdash;Your
sarvent till death: and that, I think,
won&rsquo;t be long now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m jist thinking, that may be your ladyship
would&rsquo;nt be happy without you&rsquo;d a boy to
be doing for: and there&rsquo;s him, sure, that&rsquo;s up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
at the castle now, my poor boy, and there isn&rsquo;t
a finer boy in the wide world; and if I thought
that your ladyship would jist take him in place
of the misthress&rsquo;s child, and do for him, I would
die quite aisy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus ended the nurse&rsquo;s epistle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should certainly,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Montgomery
to Mr. Jackson, &ldquo;believe this strange
letter to be genuine, from the perfect simplicity
of the style, but that the writer appears to be
too illiterate to have been any thing so decent
as a nurse in such a family as is here described.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; replied Mr. Jackson, &ldquo;does not at
all invalidate the evidence of this extraordinary
document; for, nurses intended merely to supply
the nutriment denied by unnatural mothers
to their offspring, must be chosen with reference
chiefly to their youth, health, and wholesome<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>ness
of constitution; and, in great country families,
they are naturally selected from among
the simplest of the surrounding peasantry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The letter, bearing, as we have said, no date
of time or place, the first and most obvious
step seemed to be, to inquire very particularly
where, and by whom, it had been brought to
the house. The outside of the mysterious dispatch
was shown to, and examined, by most of
the servants, without other effect than a disclaiming
shake of the head, although each
turned it upside down, and downside up, and
viewed it, not only before the light, but through
the light, as with the light through, is generally
expressed.</p>

<p>Mrs. Smyth, indeed, allowed that, as the bit
of a scrawl was vara like a petition, it was no
impossible that she hersel&rsquo; meud ha&rsquo; just laid it
o&rsquo; the mistress&rsquo;s table; for the mistress, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
sure, never refused tle read ony peur body&rsquo;s bit
o&rsquo; paper, however unlarned or dirty it meud be.</p>

<p>At length John, the under-footman, made his
appearance, and after examining the shape, hue,
and dimensions of the folded paper, said, that
it was not unlike one which he had taken about
six months since from a strange looking man,
who had come to the door, requesting to see his
mistress, on the very day that &mdash;&mdash;, and he
hesitated&mdash;that every body was in so much
trouble, he added.</p>

<p>Mr. Jackson, seeing Mrs. Montgomery turn
pale, took up the questioning of John. And
here, lest the said John&rsquo;s powers of description
should not do justice to his subject, we shall
give the scene between him and the nurse&rsquo;s messenger,
exactly as it occurred.</p>

<p>The stranger was tall and well made, with a
countenance, the leading characteristic of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
was, now drollery, and now defiance; whilst its
secondary, and more stationary expression, was
equally contradictory, being made up of shrewdness
and simplicity, most oddly blended. He
carried a reaping-hook in one hand, and, with
the other, held over his shoulder a large knotted
stick, with a bundle slung on the end of it.</p>

<p>This personage, on the melancholy day alluded
to, arrived at the closed and silent entrance
of Lodore House. Disdaining to use the
still muffled, and therefore, in his opinion, noneffective
knocker, he substituted the thick end
of his own stick. This strange summons was
answered by John.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is it affeard of a bit of a noise you
are?&rdquo; was the first question asked by the
stranger. Without, however, waiting for reply,
he was about to pass in, saying, &ldquo;Just show us
which is the mistress, will yee?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>
<p>The powdered lackey, astonished at such want
of etiquette, placed an opposing hand against
the breast of the intruder; upon which the stranger,
after a momentary look of unfeigned surprise,
very quietly laid down his reaping-hook,
bundle, and stick, behind him, (for the latter he
would not deign to use against an unarmed
foe,) then planting his heels as firmly together
as though he had grown out of the spot whereon
he stood, he cocked his hat (none of the newest)
on three hairs, put his arms a-kimbo, and his
head on one side; and, his preparations thus
completed, with a knowing wink, said, &ldquo;Now
I&rsquo;ll tell you what, my friend, I&rsquo;d as soon crack
the scull of yee, as look at yee!&rdquo;</p>

<p>John, even by his own account, stepped
back a little, while saying, &ldquo;You had better
not raise a hand to me: for if you do, there are
half a dozen more of us within, to carry you to
Carlisle gaol.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Half a dozen!&rdquo; cried our unknown hero,
in a voice of contempt, and snapping his fingers
as he spoke, &ldquo;the divil a much I&rsquo;d mind half a
dozen of you, Englishers, with your gingerbread
coats, and your floured pates, for all the
world as if you had been out in the snow of a
Christmas day, with never a hat on; that is, if
I had you onest in my own dacent country,
where one can knock a man down in pace and
quietness if he desarve it, without bothering
wid yeer law for every bit of a hand&rsquo;s turn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>During the latter part of this speech he
turned to his bundle, and kneeling on one knee,
untied it, took a small parcel out of it, unrolled
a long bandage of unbleached linen cloth from
about the parcel, next a covering of old leather,
that seemed to have once formed a part of a
shamoy for cleaning plate, then several pieces
of torn and worn paper, and at length, from
out the inmost fold, he produced a letter, which,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
as he concluded, he held up between his thumb
and finger, saying, &ldquo;There it is now! I mane
no harm at all at all, to the misthress; nothing
but to give her this small bit of paper, that the
dying woman put into my hands, in presence of
the priest, and that hasn&rsquo;t seen the light o&rsquo; day
since till now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John told him, that if that was all, he might
be quite easy, as his delivering the letter at the
house was the same thing as if he handed it to
his lady herself; for that all his lady&rsquo;s letters
were carried in by the servants.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And is she so great a lady as all that,&rdquo;
said the stranger, &ldquo;that a poor man can&rsquo;t have
spache of her? But I&rsquo;ve had spache, before
now, of the great lady up at the castle, sure,
and its twiste, aye, three times as big as that
house.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After some more parleying, in the course of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
which John disclosed the peculiar circumstances
in which his mistress then was, our faithful
messenger, after ejaculating, with a countenance
of true commiseration, &ldquo;And has she, the crathur?&rdquo;
at length seemed to feel the necessity of
consenting to what he considered a very irregular
proceeding, namely, the sending in of the
letter; not, however, till he had first compelled
John to kiss the back of it, and, in despite of
the evidence of his own senses, to call it a blessed
book, and holding one end, while our pertinacious
friend held the other, to repeat after him
the words of a long oath, to deliver it in safety.
This, John proceeded to say, he did immediately,
by giving the letter to one of the women
to carry into his mistress&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Mrs. Montgomery, with a
sigh, &ldquo;I must have laid it down without opening,
and forgotten it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. Jackson observed, that from the expression,
&ldquo;over seas to the harvest,&rdquo; and also the
man&rsquo;s appearance, it was very evident he must
be one of those poor creatures who come over
in shiploads from the north of Ireland to Whitehaven,
during the reaping season; and that this
fact, once admitted, seemed to render it more
than probable, that the noble family spoken of
were Irish. As to the important particulars of
names and titles, there seemed but one chance
of obtaining them; which was, to institute an
immediate search after the young man who had
brought the letter. Every inquiry was accordingly
made, but in vain.</p>

<p>After some months, Mr. Jackson himself, in
the warmth of his zeal, undertook a journey to
Ireland; but returned, without having been
able to discover any clue to the business. Advertisements
were next resorted to, but no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
claimed Edmund. The letter had said, that
&ldquo;those it concerned most were,&rdquo; in the nurse&rsquo;s
phraseology, &ldquo;not to the fore.&rdquo; Whether
death, or absence from the kingdom was meant,
it was impossible to say.</p>

<p>The harvest season of the next year came
and went, but the wandering knight of the
reaping-hook was heard of no more; and Mrs.
Montgomery, while her better judgment condemned
the feeling, could not conceal from herself,
that she experienced a sensation of reprieve,
on finding that she was not immediately to be
called upon to resign her little charge. Poor
Edmund had now become to her a kind of
sacred pledge; every thought and feeling that
regarded him, was associated with the memory
of her dear departed child, who had taken so
benevolent a delight in protecting and cherishing
the helpless being she had rescued from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
misery, and almost certain death. Could the
mourning mother then leave undone any thing
that that dear child, had she lived, would have
done? The absolute seclusion too, in which
grief for the loss of her daughter, induced Mrs.
Montgomery to live, gave all that concerned
this object, of an interest thus connected with
the feelings of the time, an importance in her
eyes, which, under any other circumstances,
would scarcely, perhaps, have been natural.</p>

<p>Gradually, however, the prospect of discovering
who Edmund&rsquo;s parents were, faded almost
entirely away; but the conviction that
they must be noble was, from the period
of the receipt of the nurse&rsquo;s packet, firmly fixed
on the mind, both of his benefactress and of
Mr. Jackson. The style, indeed, of the letter
itself, left no doubt of the veracity of the
writer; while the manners of him who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
been the bearer of the strange epistle, the
conversation of the man and woman on the
Keswick road, nay, the very state in which the
poor child was first found&mdash;were all corroborating
evidences.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord</span> L. remembered, and even experienced,
something of a consolatory feeling, in faithfully
performing the promise which, within the first
happy year of his marriage, he had made to
his beloved wife, and which had seemed to give
her so much pleasure: we mean that which re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>spected
placing and advancing Edmund in the
navy. His lordship accordingly wrote from
abroad to his friend, Lord Fitz Ullin, and Edmund,
at the age of twelve, was received into
the naval college at Portsmouth.</p>

<p>This was, no doubt, a very wise and proper
arrangement; yet there were those to whom it
caused infinite grief: we speak of the twins,
who, though they had never been expressly
told that Edmund was their brother, had
learned to love him as such; and whether they
really thought he was so, or never thought
about the matter, were in the habit, in all their
little plays and pastimes, of calling him brother
Edmund, and fancying that nothing could be
done without him.</p>

<p>His vacations, however, were all spent at
Lodore House, and were joyful in proportion
to the sorrows of parting.   On the first of those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
memorable occasions, Mrs. Montgomery absolutely
wept over him; Frances frolicked round
him, as if obliged to exhaust herself by fatigue,
to moderate her transports; while little Julia
stood silently, and with a pensive expression,
quite close to him; and when, after performing
any extraordinary new feat for the amusement
of Frances, he would stoop, and ask of his
little favourite what he should do for her, she
would answer, with a glow of enthusiasm,
&ldquo;Stay always with me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He generally brought some tasks home,
which were to be learned before his return
to college. When he sat at these, Frances
would fidget round the table, in visible discontent&mdash;stop
straight opposite to him, put her
head on one side, watch to meet his eye, and
make him laugh; failing in this, try to play
alone; and finding this also dreadfully stupid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
return to the charge; while Julia would get on
a part of his chair, hold his hand and remain
perfectly still, till the hand was borrowed to
turn over a leaf, when she would follow it with
an appealing look, which look, being repaid by
a fond caress, she would retake the hand, and
sit again as motionless as before. At length,
poor Lady Frances, infected by the dullness of
her companions, would sometimes bring a
chair on the other side, and insist on having
the other hand, which would reduce Edmund
to the necessity of fastening his book open on
the table with another book; after which
arrangement, we must confess, that, however
unjust the proceeding, and notwithstanding the
remonstrances of the injured party, it was
always the hand which Frances held, which
was borrowed to turn over leaves, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>But there was something in little Julia&rsquo;s en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>thusiastic
manner of showing attachment, which
won upon the affections in an extraordinary degree,
and made her almost unjustly the favourite;
poor Frances, considering her lively temper,
loved brother Edmund full as well, in her
own way.</p>

<p>Thus passed two years; and at fourteen,
Edmund was appointed to the same ship
on board which Henry then happened to be.
The vessel was ready for sea, and going on a
foreign station, on which it was to remain for
three years. Our hero, after joining, obtained
a few days&rsquo; leave, that he might pay a farewell
visit to Lodore. Arrived at the last stage of
his journey, he stopped at the little inn, and
put on his midshipman&rsquo;s dress, which he had
brought with him, from a boyish wish to surprise
his two little sisters, as he called the
twins, now about seven years old. Accordingly,
he entered the domestic circle fully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
equipped, and produced, at least, as great a
sensation as his beating heart, while jumping
out of the carriage, and hastening across the
lawn, had anticipated.</p>

<p>As soon as the first clamorous joy of meeting,
as well as the first public examination of
every part of his dress was over, Frances possessed
herself of his cocked-hat, dirk, and belt,
and began arraying herself in the spoils.
While Mrs. Montgomery, drawing him near
her chair, began to question him as to how long
he could now remain with them, and when he
thought he should be able to return. Little
Julia stood close at the other side of her grandmother,
her eyes raised, and passing from one
countenance to the other, watching every word.
When Edmund answering, that he must leave
them early in the morning, and that it would
be, at least, three years before he could hope
to see them again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Three years!&rdquo; exclaimed Julia, turning
as red as crimson for one moment, and the next
as pale as death! Edmund took her on his
knee, kissed her little forehead, and remonstrated
fondly. At length, showers of tears
came to her relief; and amid reiterated sobs,
she articulated, in broken accents, &ldquo;No! I
cannot bear the thoughts of summer coming
three times without Edmund! Oh! I&rsquo;ll hate
summer, that I used to love so much!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, Julia! my darling Julia!&rdquo; said Edmund,
&ldquo;why should you hate summer? You
know, I must be far away in the winter also.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I must only hate winter too!&rdquo; said
Julia, as well as her continued sobs would
permit; &ldquo;but you used to come back in the
summer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the little Lady Frances, quite
unconscious of the tragic scene, was standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
before a large mirror, at the far end of the
room, contemplating her tiny form, surmounted
by the cocked-hat, tried on in all the varieties
of fore and aft, athwart ships, &amp;c. &amp;c. Now,
perfectly satisfied with her own appearance,
she advanced on tip-toe, that her height, as
well as her dress, might, as much as possible,
resemble Edmund&rsquo;s. But perceiving Julia&rsquo;s
tears, and being informed of their cause, she
flung away hat and dirk, and threw herself into
her sister&rsquo;s arms, and joined in her sobs&mdash;with
a violence proportioned to the sudden transition
of her feelings. Nothing could console the
little girls, and it being late in the evening,
they were obliged to be sent to bed; to which
measure, after some demurring, and many last
words, they consented, for the purpose of being
up very early, as they could not think of an
over-night farewell. Locked in each other&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
arms, and planning to stay awake all night, lest
they should not be called in time, they cried
themselves to sleep; and, alas! ere their eyes
started open in the morning, early as that was,
the unconscious cheek of each had received
Edmund&rsquo;s parting kiss, and he was already
some way on his journey.</p>

</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> days more, and our hero&rsquo;s ship, the
Glorious, was on the high seas. It was night.
Edmund had had the early watch&mdash;had been relieved&mdash;had
retired to his hammock&mdash;had fallen
into a sound sleep, and was dreaming of Lodore.
Suddenly, his pleasing vision became troubled.
A thunder-storm arose; the loud peal rolled,
and resounded from mountain to mountain:
the little girls shrieked. He started awake!
and found the scene indeed different; but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
noises which had occasioned his dream, real.
The drum was beating to quarters; signal-guns
were firing; and all hands hastening on deck.
He jumped out of his hammock. The officers
were all getting up; the men were casting the
great guns loose, knocking away the bulk-heads,
and tumbling them, as well as all the
furniture of the cabins&mdash;trunks, tables, chairs,
&amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;pell-mell together, down into the hold,
with a tremendous clatter. In short, the ship
was clearing for action. She was also tacking
to close with the enemy, and her deck, in consequence,
was greatly crowded: blue lights
burning, rockets going off, sails flapping, yards
swinging, ropes rattling, and the tramping of
feet excessive; while the voice of the officer
giving orders was heard, from time to time,
resounding through all. The vessel they were
approaching, carried two stern-lights, indi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>cating
that a vice-admiral was on board.
While all eyes were fixed upon her, she drew
near slowly, and on coming up, opened
at once all the ports of her three decks,
displaying a blaze of lights which, amid the
surrounding darkness, had much grandeur of
effect, not only dazzling by its sudden brightness,
but exhibiting, as it were, in proud defiance,
the strength of the broadside, which was
thus ready to salute a foe. The vessels now
hailed each other, and lo! proved to be both
English! The supposed enemy was the Erina,
Admiral Lord Fitz Ullin, returning from Gibraltar.
All hopes of fighting thus at an end,
both men and officers were, to use their own
expression, &ldquo;confoundedly disappointed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They soon, however, had fighting enough;
so much, that to give any account of the various
actions they were in, would, we fear, be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
tedious; and, to those unacquainted with naval
affairs, uninteresting; we shall not, therefore,
attempt it, but passing over about four years of
our hero&rsquo;s life, proceed at once to his return to
Old England, a fine, promising lad, of nineteen&mdash;a
great favourite with all the officers, and in
high estimation with the captain, having already
given many proofs of spirit, and being always
remarkable for regularity and good conduct.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">

<p>
&ldquo;From ocean&rsquo;s mist, the white-sailed fleet arose!<br />
First, a ridge of clouds it seemed; but brighter<br />
Shone the sun&mdash;and the distant ships stood forth,<br />
Their wet sides glittering in all his beams!&rdquo;<br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 12em;">&ldquo;Heavens!</span><br />
Must I renounce honour, reputation?&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> the Glorious anchored in Cawsand Bay, in
company with a numerous fleet, the animated
prospect which presented itself, especially in its
combined effect with the state of the atmosphere,
uniting a bright sunny glow with a fog,
consequently, of a peculiar whiteness, possessed
a degree and style of beauty not easily imagined
by any one unaccustomed to harbour scenery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span></p>

<p>It was the noon of a frosty day: the
sun which, as we have observed, shone
brightly, gave to the face of the waters the
appearance of a sheet of light. The heights
around, and all other distant objects, were
covered with the smoky veil of white fog,
already noticed, which reduced them to shades
of the neutral tint; while, on the side of the
nearest hill, the clumps of wood and undulations
of ground were plainly visible, and
along its topmost line some scattered trees stood
curiously and beautifully traced against the
pale, even mistiness of all behind. In the bay,
too, the nearest range of ships, with all the
varied and still varying forms of their floating
canvass, (for almost all the fleet at this time
were employed in furling their sails,) every mast,
every cord, each figure standing beneath the
picturesque canopy of a sail-boat, or stretching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
to the oars of a row-boat, were all strongly
defined, and appeared, from contrast with the
snowy whiteness of the fog behind them, black
as ebony; while the more distant vessels, being
deeper and deeper sunk in the shrouding atmosphere,
were more and more faintly shown,
till the farthest seemed but one degree more
palpable than the mist itself. The wind, soon
after the fleet anchored, died away entirely,
and all that had been activity and bustle,
changed to the most peculiar repose; as though
the beautiful picture, once completed, was left
to delight posterity; for nothing now moved
as far as the eye could reach, except that, from
time to time, a gleam reflected from the flat,
wet oar of some row-boat, plying between ship
and ship, shot, like a flash of summer lightning,
across the still and shadowy scene.</p>

<p>During the anchoring of the fleet, one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
ships, by some mischance, got aground, and all
the others were ordered to send boats immediately
to her assistance. The task was laborious,
and much disorder occurred in the tiers
of the stranded vessel, where the sailors, taking
advantage of the confusion which prevailed,
had broken into the spirit-room, and were regaling
themselves with rum. Towards evening,
however, with the help of the tide, she was
got off the rocks, and the signal being given
for the boats which had been sent to her assistance
to return alongside their respective ships,
Edmund and Henry, with their boats and
crews, did not obey the signal with their usual
promptitude. Edmund, meanwhile, after going
through great exertion the whole day, was still
on board the vessel so lately got off, commanding
his men in the most peremptory manner
into his boat, when Henry observing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
he appeared heated and fatigued, and
thinking that, at such a time, a very little
would overcome one not accustomed to excess,
drew towards him a second glass, (for he had
been drinking freely,) and filling both that and
his own, said, &ldquo;How heated you are, Montgomery!
you will kill yourself, if you don&rsquo;t
take something!&rdquo; at the same time offering
him one of the glasses. Edmund answered instantly,
and with indignation, that were it but
water, and were he expiring with fatigue, it
should not, in such a place, and at such a
time, approach his lips! Henry stared at him,
lifted the glass to his head, and, with a laugh,
swallowed its contents. Edmund again remonstrated,
and taking Henry, who was by
this time very much intoxicated, by the arm,
endeavoured to draw him away. Henry staggered,
fell, dragged Edmund with him, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
at the same time, seizing the handle of a can
of spirits, which stood on the cask, trailed it
after him, emptying its odoriferous contents on
our hero&rsquo;s breast and face, as he rolled with
him on the floor.</p>

<p>At this unfortunate moment, a lieutenant,
sent in search of the boats and midshipmen,
which were missing, entered, and seeing both
officers on the deck drenched in rum, two
glasses on the barrel-head beside them, the spirit-can
in their arms, and, apparently, the object of
contention, as they struggled together on the
floor while their men stood round them drinking,
laughing, and swearing, he very naturally drew
most unfavourable conclusions. Edmund, as
soon as he could release himself from Henry&rsquo;s
grasp, arose; but so much heated, and so
thoroughly ashamed of the situation in which he
had been found, that he looked quite confused.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
He attempted to speak, but was silenced, and
very harshly repulsed by the lieutenant to
whom he addressed himself, who told him,
with an air of the utmost contempt, at the same
time holding a handkerchief to his nose, that
while he smelt of spirits in so disgusting a
manner, it was impossible to listen to him.</p>

<p>Our hero reddened with indignation, and
repaired to his boat without further attempt
at explanation, not doubting, however, that
he should be able to justify himself ultimately.
Henry was obliged to be carried
to his boat, and thus did all return to the
ship. The necessary report being made to
Captain B., he was so much incensed, that he
sent an order for both young men to quit the
ship in half an hour, directing that, with their
sea-chests beside them, they should be left on
the nearest beach, to find their way home as
they might.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>Edmund begged to be heard. The captain
refused, sending him word that it was impossible
for him to permit gentlemen to remain
in his ship, who had disgraced themselves
by carousing among the common sailors.
There was then no longer a hope! He must
get into the boat. He did so; and, as they
pushed off, another boat, in which sat a midshipman,
(a stranger to Edmund,) passed them,
and then ran alongside the ship, taking up
the position they had just quitted.</p>

<p>The sun, a moment before, had dropped below
the horizon. Edmund folded his arms, sighed, and
resigned himself to his fate; then rested his eyes
almost unconsciously on the scene before him.
The water in the bay was still as a frozen lake,
its face one sheet of cold transparent light,
marking, by contrast, the pitchy darkness which
twilight had already imparted to the hills that
rose around it, and to every opaque object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
laying or moving on its peaceful surface. Perpetual,
though imperceptibly wrought changes
were each moment taking place in every thing
around. The clouds near the horizon breaking,
the still illumined western sky shed awhile a
brilliant ray: the clouds closed again, and left
all darker than before. The trees on the
western hill stood for a few seconds strongly
defined by the parting beam; then faded with
the fading light. Some of the larger vessels,
more lately arrived than the rest of the fleet,
with majestic progress passed slowly to their
places of anchorage. Single-masted boats,
(warned by the approach of evening,) one by
one drew smoothly towards the shore, changing,
as they did so, at each moment, the disposition
of their sails; and, finally, taking all down as
they came to for the night under shelter of a
projecting point. Alongside the same point,
numerous row-boats, having shipped their oars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
as they drew near, fell silently; while the
single figure that had guided each, might
shortly after be traced wandering homeward
along the extended beach.</p>

<p>When the boat in which our hero sat
had gone about twenty yards, they were
hailed from their own ship, and desired
by the officer of the watch to lay on their
oars till further orders. Some time of anxious
suspense followed, during which the approaches
of night were as rapid as they were
silent, and all objects were visibly shrouding
themselves in that mysterious gloom which imagination
loves to people with shadowy forms,
when the flash of the evening gun was seen
from the admiral&rsquo;s ship, followed by a report
which, with startling effect, broke upon the
universal stillness, then rolled along like distant
thunder up the harbour. As the last sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
died away, they were hailed again, ordered to
come alongside, and Mr. Montgomery to come
on board. Our hero obeyed the order, and
was not a little surprised, on reaching the deck,
to find all the ship&rsquo;s company assembled there.
In a few minutes, the captain and officers,
preceded by lights, and accompanied by the
strange midshipman who had passed the boat
on its first quitting the ship, ascended the
hatchway, and arranged themselves on the
quarter-deck. Edmund was ordered to draw
near. He did so; when the captain, addressing
the stranger, in a tone which showed he
wished to be heard by all present, said, &ldquo;Lord
Ormond, will you have the goodness to repeat,
in the hearing of my officers and the whole
ship&rsquo;s company, the deposition you have made
to me respecting Mr. Montgomery.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The stranger, a mild-looking lad, about Ed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>mund&rsquo;s
own age, came forward and said, that
he had been in the tiers of the stranded vessel,
calling off his own men, when Mr. Montgomery
came in to collect his; that his attention had
been fixed by that gentleman&rsquo;s very proper
conduct, which he here explained minutely,
dwelling on our hero&rsquo;s effort to rescue Henry;
and his declaration, that were the beverage but
water, he would not, for example sake, suffer a
glass to be seen approach his lips, &amp;c., till he
came to where Edmund was pulled to the
ground by the fall of Henry. He then proceeded
to say, that he himself was about to
go to his assistance, when, seeing the officer
who came in search of both young men enter,
he had hurried to his own boat, it being
late.</p>

<p>Here the captain again spoke, saying, that as
all had had reason to believe Mr. Montgomery&rsquo;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
conduct disgraceful, he had deemed it necessary
that all should be thus publicly informed of his
innocence, as well as made sensible of his, the
captain&rsquo;s, sufficient reasons for so sudden a
change of measures towards him. He then
turned to our hero, and expressed himself as
highly gratified, to find the favourable opinion
he had formed of his character thus justified.
Captain B. here renewed the order to have Mr.
St. Aubin immediately sent a-shore.</p>

<p>The stranger, Lord Ormond, who was the
son of Admiral Lord Fitz-Ullin, got himself
presented to Mr. Montgomery; and Edmund,
anxious to express his gratitude, requested his
new acquaintance to tell him by what fortunate
circumstance he had become his deliverer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If any one deserves that title,&rdquo; answered
Ormond, &ldquo;it is my father. I fear I was rather
negligent in not remaining to assist you; but I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
had been already detained much too late. In
my own justification, I described the scene I
had just witnessed, and the consequent interest
I could not avoid taking in what was passing;
when, happening to say that the other gentleman
called you Montgomery, my father repeated
the name, and, after considering for a
moment, exclaimed, &lsquo;Why, that is the name
of Lord L.&rsquo;s young friend! If it be the same,
he must be in the Glorious, Captain B., which
came in this morning with the Cadiz fleet.&rsquo; I
mentioned about what age you appeared to be;
upon which my father started up, saying, &lsquo;I
could almost venture to affirm, that that young
man has got into a serious scrape! You had
better, Ormond,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;go instantly
on board the Glorious, present my compliments
to Captain B., and recount all you witnessed of
the business.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>
<p>Before the young men parted, Ormond gave
a message, of which he was the bearer, inviting
Mr. Montgomery to dine with Lord Fitz-Ullin
on the following day.</p>

&ldquo;A vision came in on the moon-beam.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Henry</span>, left on the beach, with his chest beside
him, slept heavily for some hours. When he
awoke it was night. He lay on the shingles.
He felt the fresh breath of the breeze, as, from
time to time, it lifted the hair on his fevered
temples. He heard the dash of each billow as
it struck the shore, and the rattle of the loose
stones, as each wave retired again, down the
extended sloping bank of smooth pebbles, on
which his head was pillowed. Thinking it all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
a dream, he remained for some moments motionless;
when, becoming more clearly awake,
he sat up, and passed his hand across his eyes,
as it were to rectify their vision.</p>

<p>The moon had risen over the expanse of
waters before him. He gazed on the sparkling
of her myriad beams, mingling in fairy
dance o&rsquo;er all the solitary waste, for not a
sail or mast appeared. He looked on his right
hand, and on his left; here too all was loneliness!</p>

<p>His ideas still bewildered, he rested his
eyes on the pillar of light, which the bright
orb exactly opposite to him, and still near the
horizon, had flung across the whole ocean,
planting its base at his very feet. On a
sudden this dazzling object became obscured,
and he beheld, standing over him, and intercepting
its refulgence, the same remarka<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>ble
figure which, it may be remembered, Mr.
Jackson had seen walking with him, about
eight years since, in the shrubbery at Lodore

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> next day, according to appointment, Edmund
went to dine on board the Erina. Arriving
rather early, he found Lord Fitz-Ullin
alone in his cabin, reading a newspaper.</p>

<p>His lordship received our hero with the
greatest cordiality, saying, he was happy to
have it in his power to show any mark of atten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>tion,
however trifling, to the young friend of
Lord L.; &ldquo;particularly,&rdquo; he added, smiling,
&ldquo;as my office of patron is, I understand, to be
quite a sinecure, I am the more called upon to
discover minor modes of proving my friendship.
You have already, I am informed, Mr. Montgomery,&rdquo;
he continued, &ldquo;by your gallant conduct,
so far cut your own way, that you are to
receive your commission immediately, without
any interference on my part. But, remember,
my interest is only laid up for the first occasion
on which it may be required, when you shall
command it in a double proportion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edmund was commencing a speech of thanks,
but was prevented by Lord Fitz-Ullin, who
said, &ldquo;By the bye, Ormond is going up to the
next examination, which will take place in a
day or two. Had you not better go with him?
You can then pass, and be made, without any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
unnecessary delays; and, if you have no objection
to sail with me, we can have you appointed
to the Erina on your promotion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edmund was delighted with this arrangement;
and, as he smiled, and made his grateful
acknowledgments, and even when he had concluded,
he observed Lord Fitz-Ullin&rsquo;s eyes resting
on his features with a lingering expression
of interest which surprised him, and therefore
made him look grave. For a moment or two
Lord Fitz-Ullin continued to gaze at him, as if
waiting for something; and then, with an air
of disappointment, sat down, and resumed his
newspaper.</p>

<p>Ormond entering, and joining Edmund, the
young people conversed with animation, but
apart, that they might not interrupt the admiral&rsquo;s
reading. Edmund, however, saw that
the newspaper was little regarded, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
Lord Fitz-Ullin&rsquo;s eyes were generally turned on
his countenance. He felt rather embarrassed
by so strict a scrutiny, but contrived to maintain
the appearance of not noticing it, except
that he coloured a little.</p>

<p>Lord Fitz-Ullin rose, came forward, and joining
them, asked Edmund if he thought Ormond
like him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have scarcely ever seen a likeness so
strong as that of Lord Ormond to your lordship,&rdquo;
answered Edmund.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Such is the general opinion,&rdquo; said Lord
Fitz-Ullin; &ldquo;but it is a stationary likeness, consisting
in feature. What a fascination there is
about that gleam of resemblance, found only in
expression, which comes and goes with a smile,
particularly when the likeness is to one who has
been dear to us, and who no longer exists!
We wait for it, we watch for it! and, when it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
comes, it brings momentary sunshine to the
heart, and is gone again, with all the freshness
of its charm entire, the eye not having had
time to satisfy itself with a full examination
into its nature or degree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letters were at this moment brought in, and
the admiral opened one, which he excused himself
for reading, saying, it was from Lady
Fitz-Ullin. The entrance of the rest of the company
now diversified the scene, and dinner soon
followed.</p>

<p>During the remainder of the day and evening,
the intimacy between our hero and his
young friend, Oscar Ormond, such was Lord
Ormond&rsquo;s name, made rapid progress; and both
the lads looked forward, with equal pleasure,
to the prospect of Edmund&rsquo;s being appointed
to the Erina.</p>

<p>There was an innocent openness about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
manners of Oscar Ormond, proceeding from
perfectly harmless intentions, which, to one so
young as Edmund, and, himself of a disposition
peculiarly frank, was very attractive. In
Oscar, however, this winning quality, never
having been cultivated into a virtue, had remained
a mere instinct, and was even in danger
of degenerating into a weakness&mdash;we mean that
of idle egotism. While Edmund&rsquo;s native candour,
equally, in the first instance, springing
from an honest consciousness of having no motive
to conceal a thought, had, during that
earliest period of education, so vitally important,
been trained and sustained by the skilful hand
of Mr. Jackson; and, therefore, already was
accompanied by undeviating veracity on principle,
and a consequent firmness of mind, worthy
of riper years. This gave our hero an ascendancy
over his young friend, which might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
said to have commenced at their very first
interview; and which, in their after lives,
frequently influenced the conduct of both,
though neither, perhaps, was conscious of its
existence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> this time there was no passing in any sea-port,
but before three captains. Oscar and
Edmund, therefore, proceeded to town. The
anxious hour, big with the fate of many a
middy, arrived. The friends, accordingly,
having already got through their first examination
with success, now wended their way to the
great centre of naval hopes and fears, to answer
such final queries as it might be judged necessary
to put to them. Entering an ante-room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
they approached a standing group of youngsters,
who, probably, had not much interest to
smooth their path, for their conversation chiefly
turned on subjects of discontent. One, whose
name was Bullen, and who had once been a
messmate of Ormond&rsquo;s, seemed to be chief
spokesman. He was growling at the additional
difficulty which, he asserted, there was now
every day in passing. &ldquo;A young man might
know it all well enough aboard,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but
to have a parcel of old-wigs staring a fellow in
the face, and asking him puzzlers, why, it was
enough to scatter the brains of any one of common
modesty!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If that is all,&rdquo; said one of his companions,
for middies are not ceremonious, &ldquo;there is no
fear of you, Bullen: your modesty will never
stand in your way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope not,&rdquo; answered Bullen, &ldquo;nor any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
thing else, if I can help it. At any rate, I
should be sorry to be quite so soft a one as
Armstrong! Only think,&rdquo; he continued, turning
to Ormond, &ldquo;only think of that foolish
fellow Armstrong! One of the old-wigs asked
him (saw he was soft, I suppose) the simplest
question in the world, just to try him. Well,
old-wig stares him in the face, and looking devilish
knowing, says, &lsquo;Suppose yourself, Sir,
in a gale of wind on a lee shore, the ship in
great danger of going on the rocks, when, the
wind suddenly shifting, you are taken all
aback, what, Sir, would you do in this critical
juncture?&rsquo; Instead of answering, &lsquo;Clap on
sail, and put out to sea,&rsquo; poor Armstrong took
it for granted he should not have been asked
the question if it were not a puzzler, and was
so confounded, that he looked like a fool, and
had not a word to say, till the old-wigs themselves
were all obliged to laugh out.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>
<p>At this moment Bullen was sent for to attend
the said old-wigs, as he called them; and
though he still tried to bluster, he coloured to
the very roots of his hair at the awful summons.
On his return, however, he came laughing
and swaggering, and bolting into the midst
of the still standing group, he seized a button
of Ormond&rsquo;s coat with one hand, and of Edmund&rsquo;s
with the other, and began to tell his
story.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you passed? have you passed?&rdquo; cried
many voices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I passed!&rdquo; repeated Bullen. &ldquo;There
is no difficulty in passing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought it was very difficult, a short time
since,&rdquo; observed Ormond.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, well&mdash;so it may be to some: I found
no difficulty, however. But listen till I tell
you the fun. They thought they had got
another Armstrong to deal with, I suppose;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
for one of the old fellows, looking as wise as
Solomon, and as pompous as the grand Mogul,
turned his eyes full on me, and began. I felt
mine inclined to take a peep at my shoe-buckles;
but, mustering all my courage, I raised them,
stared straight in his face, clenched my teeth,
drew my heels together, thus, and stood
firm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Well, Sir!&rsquo; said old-wig, &lsquo;hitherto you
have answered well.&rsquo;&mdash;This was encouraging.
&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; he continued, &lsquo;suppose yourself on
a lee shore, under a heavy press of sail, the
wind blowing such a gale that, in short, it is
impossible to save the ship, what, Sir, would
you do?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Why, let her go ashore and be d&mdash;&mdash;d!&rsquo;
I replied. Then, thinking I had been too
rough, I added, with a bow, that I should
never take the liberty of saving a ship which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
his lordship judged it impossible to save. He
smiled, and said I had a fine bold spirit, just
fit for a brave British tar! So I sailed out of
port with flying colours, but no pennant, faith:
I heard nothing of my commission.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;what is the use of
passing, when, if a man has not the devil and
all of Scotch interest, and all that stuff, he
don&rsquo;t know when he&rsquo;ll get made; but may, in
all probability, be a <i>youngster</i> at <i>forty</i>! a
middy in the cockpit, when he is as grey as a
badger! There&rsquo;s a fellow aboard of us now,
who jumped over three times,&mdash;no less,&mdash;to save
boys who fell over the ship&rsquo;s side, and couldn&rsquo;t
swim; (he swims like a fish himself;) but he&rsquo;s
not Scotch! Well, the captain wrote word to
the Admiralty; and what reward do you think
they gave him? Why, employed one of their
sneaking under <i>scratchatories</i> to write an official<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
line and a half, importing, that &lsquo;their lordships
were pleased to approve of his conduct.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may depend upon it,&rdquo; replied Ormond,
to whom Bullen chiefly addressed himself, &ldquo;that
his name is marked for promotion, as soon as
a convenient opportunity offers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Convenient!&rdquo; interrupted Bullen: &ldquo;it
would be devilish convenient to me, I know, to
be made just now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And in the meantime,&rdquo; continued Ormond,
&ldquo;what can be more gratifying than the approbation
of the respectable heads of the department,
under which he serves his country?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said our hero, whose opinions,
like himself, were young, and therefore unsophisticated,
&ldquo;the lords of the admiralty do but
justice to the motives of British officers, when
they deem approbation the first of rewards! I
mean, of course, in a public sense; considering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
their lordships, in pronouncing that approbation,
as the organs, not only of government,
but also of the nation, on naval affairs; of
which they are constituted the judges.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; said Ormond, &ldquo;you forget how
many men, in the British navy, have risen to
the highest rank, without any interest whatever,
entirely in consequence of meritorious conduct.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was long ago,&rdquo; replied Bullen sulkily.
&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s very easy for you to talk! You, the
son of Admiral Lord Fitz-Ullin; sure of whatever
you want, and want nothing neither!
Aye, aye, that&rsquo;s the way of the world! I wish
you&rsquo;d make your father get me my commission,
I know!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other young men looked at each other,
and smiled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ormond, laughing; &ldquo;do something
very brilliant to deserve it; and if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
Admiralty give you approbation only, I pledge
myself you shall not want interest. Here is my
friend, Montgomery,&rdquo; he added, turning to
Edmund, &ldquo;saying not a word; and yet, so
just a sense have their lordships of his merits,
that he has no use for interest, though he possesses
it in the greatest profusion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he faith?&rdquo; exclaimed Bullen, &ldquo;I wish
he&rsquo;d give it to me, then!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Here all laughed out. And now Lord Ormond
was summoned. He went; and, in due
time, returned with rather a conscious smile
on his countenance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; cried Bullen. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; echoed a
dozen voices at once. &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; repeated Ormond;
but proceeded no further.</p>

<p>Edmund began to question his amused-looking
friend somewhat anxiously, as to how matters
stood; and whether there was really any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
difficulty, to one who knew what he was
about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, to tell you the truth,&rdquo; said Ormond,
laughing out at last, &ldquo;the only question they
asked me, was&mdash;But I&rsquo;ll not tell you&mdash;guess!&mdash;all
guess!&mdash;I give you fifty guesses!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Every puzzler which had been conned by
any of the party, was now proposed and rejected,
in turn; at first, with much of loud merriment;
subsiding, finally, however, into grave wonder;
for unguessed riddles are apt to grow dull.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am sure I can guess no more,&rdquo; said Edmund
at last. &ldquo;Tell!&rdquo; cried one. &ldquo;Tell!&rdquo; cried
another. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you tell!&rdquo; vociferated Bullen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ormond, &ldquo;do you all give it
up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; &ldquo;We all give it up!&rdquo; &ldquo;We
all give it up!&rdquo; answered many voices eagerly.
And the circle drew itself closer round him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; proceeded Ormond, &ldquo;they
asked me how&rdquo;&mdash;and here he hesitated and
laughed again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How what?&rdquo; cried Bullen. &ldquo;How what?&rdquo;
&ldquo;How what?&rdquo;   &ldquo;How what?&rdquo; cried all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How my father was!!!&rdquo; concluded his
lordship, trying to look grave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; exclaimed every voice at once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told you how it would be with you,&rdquo;
cried Bullen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you are not serious?&rdquo; demanded Edmund.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I am, faith!&rdquo; answered his friend.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And they asked you nothing else?&rdquo; pursued
Edmund.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Ormond&mdash;&ldquo;but, yes, they did,
by the bye; they asked me to take a glass of
wine, and a bit of cake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you passed?&rdquo; demanded Bullen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; replied Ormond.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;And are to have your commission, I suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His lordship answered in the affirmative.</p>

<p>Our hero was now summoned. He met with a
very flattering reception; and, after a respectable
examination, was informed, that his commission
should be made out immediately. He
had also the satisfaction of being expressly told,
that he was thus early promoted, to mark their
lordship&rsquo;s approbation of his gallant and meritorious
conduct, as reported by Captain B. How
different this from being turned out of the ship
in disgrace! thought Edmund.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Behold! the red stars silently descend<br />
High Cromla&rsquo;s head of clouds is grey.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Towards Temora&rsquo;s groves rolls the lofty car<br />
Of Cormac.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> next find our hero, wrapped in a large
boat cloak of blue camlet, lined with scarlet
plush, and seated on the top of a mail coach;
which, with more regard to expedition than to
comfort, travels night and day towards the
north. His anticipations were all of unmixed
delight.</p>

<p>With what fixed attention would his darling
Julia, and even the restless Frances, listen to
all he had to recount!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>

<p>How much gratified would both Mrs. Montgomery
and Mr. Jackson be, to find, that by
endeavouring to follow their wise counsels, he
had obtained the approbation of those best entitled
to judge of his conduct. And this, to
Edmund, was no trifling source of happiness.</p>

<p>Then, what an important personage must his
promotion render him in the eyes of every one!
What joy would Mrs. Smyth evince, on seeing
him return safe, and grown to be a man too!
for such, at little more than nineteen, he already
thought himself. Even one glimpse of the
gleeful countenance of the old bargeman, who
had the care of the pleasure-boat on the lake,
appeared in the far perspective of busy fancy.
Or, perhaps, this was a sort of vision; for it
was one of the last things he could remember to
have seen pass in review before his mind&rsquo;s eye,
when, over night, he had begun to nod on his
perilous throne. The hour was early, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
morning bright, when the mail set him down
where the road turns off to Lodore House.</p>

<p>He almost ran the rest of the way, and quite
breathless entered the dear haven of all his
wishes, not by the common approach, but, as
had ever been the custom of his childhood, by
one of the glass doors which open on the lawn.</p>

<p>Breakfast was laid; the urn and hot rolls,
evidently but just brought in, were smoking on
the table: yet, a general stillness prevailed, and
the room seemed without inhabitant. Edmund&rsquo;s
heart, which had been beating with violence,
stopped suddenly: he drew a longer breath, and
felt even a kind of relief; for the intensity of
expectation had arisen to almost a painful
height while he crossed the green and stepped
over the threshold.</p>

<p>Advancing a few paces into the apartment
he cast an eager look all round; and, in a far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
window, descried his darling little Julia sitting
alone; her eyes fixed on a book&mdash;her lips
moving, apparently learning a task. She looked
up, and, not quite recognising the intruder, the
first expression of her countenance was alarm.
He spoke. Her colour mounted till a universal
glow spread itself over neck, face, and arms;
not from bashfulness, for she was not quite
thirteen, therefore too young for such a feeling;
but from that extreme emotion peculiar to the
enthusiasm of her temper.</p>

<p>Edmund forgot to throw off his boat-cloak,
and enveloped the elastic fairy form of his little
favourite in its uncouth folds; while she clung
round his neck and sobbed for a considerable
time before she could speak to tell him how
glad she was to see him, and how much she
loved him still&mdash;though he had staid such a
long, long time away!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Montgomery, preceded by Frances performing
pirouettes, now entered. They had
heard nothing of Edmund&rsquo;s arrival: the old
lady, therefore, was much overcome. She embraced
him, and wept over him; for his idea
was ever associated in her feelings with that of
her lost child. Frances, after a momentary
pause, sprung into his arms, exclaiming,</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s brother Edmund! it&rsquo;s brother Edmund!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Our hero, meanwhile, swinging about in his
boat-cloak, looked rather an unwieldy monster
amongst them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear boy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Montgomery,
&ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you take off that great frightful
muffle? I want to see what you are like!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edmund looked down at himself, laughed, and
flung off the cloak, declaring he had quite forgotten
it. Mrs. Montgomery now contemplated,
with visible pleasure, his figure, become, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
its height and proportions, almost manly, without
losing any of that air of elegance, which,
from childhood, had been animate grace of Edmund&rsquo;s:
then, pointing to an ottoman close beside
her chair, she bade him sit down; and,
putting on her spectacles, for the shedding of
many tears had dimmed her sight, she kindly
stroked back the hair from his forehead, and
examined his features. Julia stood close at her
other side, holding her other hand. Frances was
off to publish the joyful tidings to good Mrs.
Smyth and the rest of the household; by singing
at every bound, &ldquo;News! news! news!&mdash;Brother
Edmund is come! brother Edmund is
come!&mdash;News! news! news!&rdquo;</p>

<p>After dropping a few large tears in silence,
Mrs. Montgomery said, mournfully,</p>

<p>&ldquo;My poor child was quite right. She always
prophesied how handsome you would be, when
I used to say you were all eyes and eyelashes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
Now, I am sure, they are just in good proportion.
She used to admire the forehead, too;
and the form of the mouth; and the sweetness
of the expression. Yes, yes! she was certainly
right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And she looked at him as though he had been
a picture, without the slightest compassion for
his blushes.</p>

<p>Edmund, willing to turn the conversation
from himself, said,</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pray, ma&rsquo;am, is it not generally thought
that Julia will be very beautiful? Did you
ever see any thing like the brilliancy of her
colour?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is very bright,&rdquo; said the old lady,
&ldquo;a sign of health, I hope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And as to her smile,&rdquo; proceeded Edmund,
&ldquo;I have always thought it the sweetest thing in
nature! even in her nurse&rsquo;s arms I can remember
being delighted with it; when the darling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
used to stretch out its little hands to come to
me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And he looked, as he spoke, into the full, uplifted,
liquid eyes of his little, listening favourite,
with a thrill of tenderness, but too prophetic of
the future.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There! look how she blushes!&rdquo; he continued,
collecting the quantity of fair hair which
hung around her neck, and playfully strewing
it again over her shoulders.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think her beautiful, of course, my dear,&rdquo;
answered Mrs. Montgomery; &ldquo;but I am partial,
you know: and so indeed are you. You
began to love her, I believe, on the very evening
she was born! I shall never forget how carefully
you supported the baby&rsquo;s head on your
little arm as you sat on this very table, I think
it was, and asked leave to kiss her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And was my presumptuous request granted,
ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; asked Edmund, laughing, and draw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>ing
little Julia kindly towards him, as though
he had some thought of repeating the presumption
of which he spoke; but she now began to
twist her head away, blush, and look half
angry: for little girls of her age, though, as
we before observed, too young to be bashful,
are very apt to be furiously modest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly, my dear,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Montgomery:
&ldquo;you were but six years of age, you
know, and poor Julia there, not an hour old at
the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice here faltered, her tears began to
flow again, and her head shook a little; an infirmity
she was able to suppress, except when
much moved. Julia, who knew the symptom
well, stole her arms round her grandmamma&rsquo;s
neck, and tried all the little coaxing ways
which she had long found the most effectual on
such occasions of mournful recollection.</p>

<span style="margin-left: 12em;">&ldquo;What tho&rsquo;</span><br />

They were our rock in danger; in triumph,<br />
The mountain whence we spread our eagle wing!&rdquo;<br />

</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Let</span> those who are fond of dramatizing their
ideas, picture to themselves the scene opening,
and displaying the wardroom of the Erina; its
centre occupied by a long breakfast-table, at
which a number of the officers are already
ranged.</p>

<p>Our hero enters, and takes his seat among
them for the first time, having joined but the
night before, just as the ship was getting under
way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus situated, he feels a very natural curiosity
to observe what his new messmates are
like. He looks around him accordingly; and
every face being equally strange to him, he
begins to amuse himself, by wondering at the
manifold and ingenious contrivances of nature,
to make such variety out of the old materials,
of eyes, nose, and mouth.</p>

<p>One gentleman sat eating an egg with great
solemnity; his elongated countenance, resembling
one seen on the back of a table-spoon,
held up the long way; while his next neighbour
smiled on a roll, with a face that seemed
reflected from the same part of the same utensil,
turned the cross way. The next, a portly gentleman,
looked as though he had stowed away,
preparatory to the long voyage, good sea-store
of claret in his cheeks, nose, and double chin.
The next to him, as spare as Don Quixote, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
a countenance the colour of a blanket; while the
hollow of his cheeks, which he had ingeniously
endeavoured to fill, by encouraging the growth
of his whiskers, resembled excavations in a disused
quarry, where tangled brambles had long
been permitted to flourish undisturbed. One
of the good-looking sat next; and the eye that
was going the circle of the table, found agreeable
rest, for a moment, on his oval countenance,
adorned by a healthful complexion, fine
eyes, and chesnut-brown hair. Next to him
appeared a bluff-looking fellow; his face deeply
pitted with the small-pox, and of a dark-red
colour, relieved only by the sooty black of
beard, hair, eye-brows, eye-lashes, eyes and
whiskers. His neighbour had a merry face, of
a lighter and brighter red, with the exception of
the forehead, which was high, open, and brilliantly
white, skirted by a thick forest of red<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
hair; while a vigorous growth of whiskers, of
the same colour, stood on each plump cheek,
like underwood on the side of a hill.</p>

<p>Nearest him, sat a tall gentleman, whom our
hero, on a further acquaintance, considered
handsome; for he had a fine fresh skin and
colour, a well-set mouth, good teeth, a high
nose, and large blue eyes; but the rise on the
nose was placed so much too high up, that it
gave a ludicrous air of mock pomp to the whole
countenance; while the eyes, peculiarly round,
opened with that species of stare, which looks
as though the cravat were tied too tight; and
the cheeks, that seemed to have been plumped
by practising the trumpet, wanting, alas! the
sheltering grace of whiskers, but too much resembled,
save in their hue, very large apple
dumplings.</p>

<p>After thus scanning the faces of so many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
good fellows, brave and jovial, though not, at
first sight, perfect beauties; our hero&rsquo;s wandering
eye arrived, at length, at a vacant seat, before
which was placed a plate, carefully covered.
At this seat and plate, he observed many of the
party looking, from time to time, with various
knowing winks and smiles, accompanied by
glances directed towards a door, leading from
one of the cabins. The said door opening shortly,
admitted a perfect personification of Sir
John Falstaff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Barns, our chaplain,&rdquo; whispered Edmund&rsquo;s
neighbour. Our hero felt uneasy: he
saw, at a glance, that Barns was the butt of the
mess; and it was not accordant with his habits,
to make a jest of the sacred office, be it held by
whom it might.</p>

<p>Mr. Barns rolled towards his seat; placed
himself upon it, and as he settled in it, seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
to spread with his own weight. He made a
sort of grunt, intended for the morning salutation;
then, stretching forward his arms, a
certain protuberance of chest and abdomen, not
permitting a nearer approach of the rest of the
person to the table, he touched lightly, with
the fore-finger and thumb of both hands, the
cover; when, finding that he was in no danger
of burning himself, he raised it. His countenance
had begun to fall a little on finding the
cover cold; but now, aghast, his under jaw
hung on his double chin; while the tongue,
spread and slighted protruded, rested on the
under-lip; for, lo!&mdash;the plate contained but
atmospheric air, and Mr. Barns was not used
to feed on the camelion.</p>

<p>He clapped down the cover, which, during
his first astonishment, he had held suspended;
and, leaning back in his chair, said, in a surly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
tone;&mdash;&ldquo;Come, come, gentlemen; this making a
jest of your chaplain, and that on Sunday morning
too, is not very becoming, let me tell you!
What must this gentleman, who is a stranger,
think of such behaviour? I am very good-natured,
sir, you must know,&rdquo; he added, looking
towards our hero, &ldquo;and these gentlemen presume
upon it.&rdquo; Edmund bowed assent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope, Mr. Barns,&rdquo; said the claret-faced
gentleman, by name Warburton, &ldquo;you mean
to make your sermon to-day at least one minute
the shorter, for this extempore lecture. Ten
minutes, you know&mdash;we never listen after ten
minutes; but promise, on the faith of a true
divine, that you will not this day exceed nine
minutes, and you shall have the real broil, that
the steward is keeping hot without.&rdquo; Mr.
Barns&rsquo; countenance became less severe, when he
heard that there actually was a real broil!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! nonsense!&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but,
there, call for the broil, or it will be too much
done: a broil is not worth a farthing without
the red gravy in it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The broil was called for accordingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are a man of honour, Barns,&rdquo; continued
Warburton; &ldquo;remember the conditions:
the sermon is not to exceed nine minutes
this morning, or ten on any future occasion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that I shall preach at all to-day,&rdquo;
said Barns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not preach at all!&rdquo; echoed the gentleman
with the high nose, making his eyes rounder
than before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, why? but, why?&rdquo; demanded various
voices.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think the day will suit,&rdquo; said
Barns, taking his eye from the door for a moment,
to glance it at the windows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You are always too timid of the weather,
Mr. Barns,&rdquo; observed Mr. Elliot, the long-faced
gentleman: &ldquo;a moderate sermon, such
as Warburton spoke of, no man can object to.
Those things, in my opinion, should not be
entirely neglected, were it but for the sake of
example to the youngsters and ship&rsquo;s company.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Example!&rdquo; repeated Barns; &ldquo;that&rsquo;s all
very proper ashore, sir; and no man set a
better example to his flock, when on terra
firma, than I did; but I have no idea of being
made an example of myself, in the fullest sense
of the word, by having my pulpit blown over
board, as might be the case, were it erected on
deck without due regard to the weather, Mr.
Elliot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nay, nay, Barns!&rdquo; interrupted Warburton,
&ldquo;there can be no danger of that, when
you are in it!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t sail without ballast, I grant you,
sir. But here comes the broil!&rdquo; said Barns.</p>

<p>The bluff gentleman, Mr. Thomson, asked
the steward, as he entered, how the day was
on deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very fine, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will it do for the pulpit?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Jones, the red-haired gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pulpit is erected already, sir, by order
of the captain,&rdquo; replied the steward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; said Jones, aside, &ldquo;this no
preaching was too good news to be true.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; asked Edmund, aside also, for
Jones sat next to him, &ldquo;is Mr. Barns&rsquo;s preaching
so very bad?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;yes&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know, faith!&rdquo; answered
Jones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you never heard Mr. Barns, then?&rdquo;
again asked Edmund.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, a thousand times!&mdash;That is&mdash;but you
see, I never listen to prosing: it&rsquo;s a bad sort
of thing, I think. In short, I generally box
the compass, or something of the sort, to amuse
myself. It&rsquo;s the best way, in my opinion,&rdquo; he
added, &ldquo;never to think at all!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There you are quite wrong, sir,&rdquo; observed
Mr. Barns, catching the last words as he wiped
his mouth, having finished his broil; &ldquo;for
spiritual food is as needful to the soul, as our
common nutriment is to the body: and inasmuch
as that body thrives best, which is best
nurtured, so will that soul, which is best instructed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That argument, from Mr. Barns, is certainly
conclusive,&rdquo; observed Mr. White, the
thin gentleman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;White,&rdquo; whispered Jones to Edmund,
&ldquo;thin as he is, eats more than Barns does!&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>
<p>All now repaired on deck, where, it is reported,
that Mr. Barns&rsquo;s presentiment proved
but too well-founded; for, that while he was
preaching, a most unexpected squall came on
a sudden&mdash;took hold of the ship&mdash;gave her one
thorough shake&mdash;and laid her on her beam-ends;
and, that all being in confusion, the men
in crowds running forward with the ropes to
shorten sail, &amp;c. &amp;c., it was some time before
he, Mr. Barns, was missed, and that when he
was missed, while one talked of lowering a boat
down, and another ran to look over the ship&rsquo;s
side, it was Mr. Montgomery, who at length
discovered him, feet uppermost, in the lee
scuppers, where the first reel of the vessel had
tumbled him, with the heavy cannonade slides,
and what not else besides, heaped on top
of him.</p>

<p>Edmund very soon perceived, that this un<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>becoming
levity of his messmates on sacred
subjects, had much of its origin in the character
of the admiral himself: for Lord Fitz-Ullin,
though a man of so much personal dignity,
that in his own manners he never offended
against outward decorum, had, unfortunately,
no settled principle on religious subjects&mdash;no
happy conviction, that moral obligations, with
all the thousand blessings that flow from them,
have but one pure and inexhaustible source, in
that simple, practical religion, which the universal
Father gave his children to promote
their happiness, temporal as well as eternal;
that religion which saith, &ldquo;Do unto others, as
you would that they should do unto you;&rdquo;
that religion, which for every possible duty,
hath a plain, practicable precept, which if followed
by all, would realize the bliss of heaven
even upon earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span></p>

<p>But Lord Fitz-Ullin had been disgusted,
by frequently, during a considerable portion of
very early life, being compelled to hear the
irrational railing of a fanatical preacher against
good works. The man might have meant
right, but he knew not how to express himself;
and Lord Fitz-Ullin, unable to adopt his doctrine,
such as it met the ear, without further
examination, rejected, or at least thenceforward
neglected, all religion. Something of this was
felt, if not seen, by those who looked up to
the admiral, as to a man older than themselves&mdash;a
man at the head of the honourable profession
to which they had devoted themselves&mdash;and
a man, as eminent in brilliancy of courage
and talent, as in rank, both hereditary and acquired.
The mischief done, therefore, bore
proportion to the extensive influence which
those shining qualities and exalted circumstances
bestowed on their possessor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<p>With respect to his lordship&rsquo;s choice of a
chaplain, being blameably indifferent on the
subject, he had appointed Mr. Barns, on the
application of a friend, without any regard
whatever to his fitness or unfitness to fill the
situation. Our hero, notwithstanding, found
his patron both a kind and most agreeable
friend; and one, whose partiality to him daily
increased. Lord Fitz-Ullin had been, all his
life, in love with glory; in Edmund he recognized
much of the same spirit, accompanied,
too, by all that romance and enthusiasm of
youth, so delightful to those, who, having retained
such feelings longer than the usual
period, find little that is congenial in the minds
of people of their own age.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish, Montgomery,&rdquo; said the Earl, one
day that Edmund dined with his lordship, &ldquo;I
wish you could inspire Ormond by your example&mdash;he
is so indolent. I fear,&rdquo; he continued,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
&ldquo;I have given him bad habits: he has always,
in fact, been sure of whatever he wished for,
without the slightest exertion on his own
part.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; said Ormond, playfully; &ldquo;you
know, sir, I am aware that I shall be an admiral
one of those days, without taking any
trouble about the matter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oscar,&rdquo; said his father, &ldquo;remember, that
though you may attain to rank by interest,
you can never obtain glory, but by deserving
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have I not the glory of being your son,
sir!&rdquo; replied Oscar, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not even a name by inheritance!&rdquo;
thought Edmund; &ldquo;I, therefore, must endeavour
to earn one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As intercourse continued, and friendship grew,
Edmund saw in his young friend daily evidences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
of a heart overflowing with every amiable
and generous sentiment; also, a high sense of
honour&mdash;worldly honour, we mean, which had
been carefully inculcated by his father.</p>

<p>Of any other standard of right, Oscar Ormond
had little or no idea. The predominant
weakness of his character, was an idle degree of
vanity about his rank&mdash;the consequence of the
early lessons of his nurse. This uneducated
and ill-judging woman, with whom he was too
much left, used carefully to give him his title
from infancy, always telling him what a grand
thing it was for him to be a lord already, when
there were so many big men, who would never
be lords! Yet, strange to say, Oscar was, as
we have seen, devoid of ambition in his profession,
to the infinite regret of his father; but he
had got it into his head, that his own hereditary
rank was something much greater than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
any thing that could be acquired, and also, that
all future steps would come, as all past ones
had done&mdash;as mere matters of course. The natural
consequences of his exalted birth!</p>

<span style="margin-left: 3em;">&ldquo;Doest thou not know me?&rdquo;</span><br />
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">A few</span> days after the fleet under the command
of Lord Fitz-Ullin had arrived on its station,
the Glorious, Edmund&rsquo;s old ship, joined, and
making the usual signal for a lieutenant from
each vessel at anchor, our hero, as officer from
the Erina, went on board. While receiving
the salutations of his former friends, his attention,
as well as theirs, was arrested by the appearance
of a boat, which was falling alongside,
and in which, if they could believe their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
own eyes, they beheld, in the shape of a lieutenant,
Mr. St. Aubin.</p>

<p>Henry came on board. All his old messmates
collecting round him, demanded clamourously
how he had got out of the scrape
in which they had left him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Scrape!&rdquo; repeated Henry, in a contemptuous
tone. &ldquo;The best thing that ever happened
to me; I might have been a poor devil
of a middy, down there in your confounded
cockpit yet, but for it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, d&mdash; it,&rdquo; said Walton, &ldquo;if I
thought they would make me a post-captain for
it, I would get drunk to night! but tell us how
you got made, man, after our throwing you out,
like spare ballast, on that rascally beach at
Plymouth?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; answered Henry, &ldquo;I waited upon
the first lord of the Admiralty, and informed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
him that I should prefer being a lieutenant to
remaining a midshipman: upon which his lordship
very politely gave me the commission I
now have the honour to hold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yier taste was sae vara uncommon, sir!&rdquo;
observed the Scot, &ldquo;that his lordship did na
care te balk ye?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Precisely so, sir,&rdquo; said Henry, with a bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, joking apart, Henry,&rdquo; said Edmund,
&ldquo;do tell us how it happened.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In fact, the friend Henry had met with at
Plymouth, but whom he did not name even to
Edmund, had informed him that Lord L. was
just returned to England on business connected
with his diplomacy, and was at that time actually
in London. Henry had set out that
night for London, waited on Lord L., and,
without any mention of his being in disgrace,
said that his time being served, he had hastened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
to town to secure, if possible, his promotion
while his lordship was on the spot. Lord L.,
accordingly, taking Henry with him, made his
application in person. The commission was
granted so immediately, that the business was
concluded before Captain B.&rsquo;s report, respecting
Mr. St. Aubin&rsquo;s unofficer-like conduct, had
reached the Admiralty. Lord L., however,
highly resented the trick thus put upon him,
and declared himself determined never again to
use any interest of his on Henry&rsquo;s behalf. And
in this resolve he persevered.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 4em;">&ldquo;Through the wide heaving of the strife,</span><br />
Are the strides of Fingall, like some strong ship<br />
Cutting through wintry seas. The dark tumbling<br />
Of death, the gleams of broken steel, mingle<br />

And roll along the field.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> followed that most brilliant era of our
naval history, which confirmed to the British
flag its supremacy on the world of waters!
Lord Fitz-Ullin had the good fortune to command
in some of the greatest, and, in their results,
the most glorious engagements of the
period: and, in each of these, Edmund distin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>guished
himself. Lord Fitz-Ullin consequently
made such creditable mention of our hero&rsquo;s
name in every account he sent home, that, after
being about two years in the Erina, he was appointed
to fill an Admiralty vacancy, as commander
of the Desdemona, a sloop-of-war, on
the same station.</p>

<p>Shortly after, another general, and to the
English successful, engagement took place. On
this occasion the services of the vessel commanded
by our hero proved so important, that
when the glorious affair was drawing to a close,
Lord Fitz-Ullin appointed Edmund to the
command of a post-ship, the Euphrasia, a
very fine frigate which had that day lost her
captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The vacancy is one which I am entitled
to fill,&rdquo; said his lordship, as he signed dispatches
in which the name of Captain Montgomery
again stood conspicuous: &ldquo;and were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
this not the case,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I could have
no doubt of the Admiralty confirming such an
officer. Oscar,&rdquo; he then said, turning kindly
to his son, &ldquo;I am sorry to leave you behind,
my boy; but I cannot, even in a public point
of view, pass over merit so distinguished as
Montgomery&rsquo;s: and, you know, Oscar, you
have never taken the trouble of doing more than
the mere routine of duty required. In short, I
have never been able to make you fond of the
service. Yet you shall have the very next ship,
though it is thus I have ever spoiled you. I
have made every step too easy,&rdquo; he added, after
a moment of silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it, sir,&rdquo; replied Oscar: &ldquo;you have
always been kind and indulgent.&rdquo; Then turning
to Edmund, and shaking hands with him, he
continued, &ldquo;Montgomery well deserves his promotion,
and I am the first to give him joy of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Oscar,&rdquo; said the earl, &ldquo;you certainly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
have a good heart; and that, after all, is, perhaps,
the first of good qualities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the next three years, every newspaper was
emblazoned with the brilliant deeds of the gallant
Captain Montgomery! We need scarcely
add, that each such newspaper was, with proud
enthusiasm, read aloud by Mr. Jackson at
Lodore House; and, by the quiet home circle
there, listened to with the liveliest interest.
An immensity of prize-money also had, from
time to time, been shared by the fleet; and
Edmund having been one year a commander,
and nearly two a post captain, his proportion of
the various sums so shared was very considerable,
amounting, in all, to upwards of fifteen
thousand pounds.</p>

<p>Henry, whose advancement had, as we have
seen, received a check, happened to be lieutenant
in the Euphrasia, when our hero was appointed
her captain.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">

<p>
&ldquo;Their eyes roll in search of the foe.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Euphrasia was detached from the fleet,
with instructions to cruise in the Archipelago,
and look out for, capture, sink, or otherwise
destroy, a formidable Turkish corsair, which
had lately committed great depredations. On
making the little island of Patras, every speck
which the face of the water presented was accordingly
examined with more than usual eagerness.
In a few hours the words, &ldquo;A sail!
a sail!&rdquo; were heard from aloft, and echoed
throughout the ship. All hands were summoned,
and the vessel crouded with canvass.</p>

<p>About six o&rsquo;clock, it being then sun-set, they
had approached near enough to the stranger for
Edmund, with the assistance of his glass, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
ascertain that she was a frigate of the largest
description, standing towards them under a
press of sail. He gave orders accordingly to
clear for action; but the wind decreasing, and
the night closing in, they lost sight of the
enemy for a considerable time. About nine
o&rsquo;clock, however, they beheld much nearer, but
imperfectly seen in consequence of the darkness,
a vessel evidently man&oelig;uvering to gain
the weather-gauge of them. They soon found
that she had failed in this attempt; upon which
they observed her stand off a little, and show
great indecision, making signals, burning blue
lights, and, at intervals, firing guns. About
ten o&rsquo;clock a flash, which preceded its report
longer than usual, was observed in a different
direction; and, immediately after, a second
large sail was discovered bearing down, as if
to join the first.</p>

<p>Edmund and his officers, having no doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
that this was the consort of the ship with which
they had been about to engage, held a short
consultation, as to the propriety of giving battle
to so unequal a force. It was, however, unanimously
decided, that they should confide in
the superior courage and seamanship of British
sailors, and commence the attack forthwith.</p>

<p>The plan to be pursued was, if possible, to
separate the enemy, in such a manner as to be
subject to the fire of one only of their vessels at
a time; but this was very shortly discovered
to be impracticable, for at the moment the
moon, which had lately risen, shining out from
behind a range of thick clouds, near the
horizon, with sudden splendour, the expanse
of waters, the distance, nature, and movements
of the enemy&mdash;all, in short, which had been
obscure or doubtful, was at once presented to
the view; and the two strangers were seen to
close with each other, and shorten sail, at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
same time displaying their sable flags and
crescents.</p>

<p>All this was clearly discernible with the
naked eye from the deck of the Euphrasia, and
placed it beyond a doubt, that the vessels in
question were Algerine corsairs.</p>

<p>Edmund gave orders to run his ship in between
the two Turkish frigates, that he might
thus, if he must receive two broadsides, at least
have one for each in return. Having succeeded
in gaining this position, and being within pistol-shot
of both ships, he opened his two broadsides
at once, with a fire so destructive, and so
much better sustained than that of the enemy,
that, in less than an hour, one of the Turks had
lost her main and mizen masts, and the other,
being much shattered in the hull, put her helm
up, for the purpose of boarding. Our hero,
perceiving this, had the guns on the quarter-deck
loaded with grape shot and musket balls,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
in place of the usual charge; and thus prepared,
waited, with perfect coolness, till the
Musselmen, armed with battle-axes and cymetars,
and uttering hideous yells, had nearly
filled the lower rigging, into which they had
leaped from that of their own ship, and whence,
in another second, they would have descended
in hordes on the forecastle and gangway, when,
giving the signal, the whole of the thus loaded
ordnance was discharged full upon the barbarians,
and with such effect, that multitudes of
bodies fell at one and the same instant; while
turbans rolled along, appearing, in the partial
light of the moon, like so many heads severed
at the same moment from so many trunks.
Such as descended alive, were instantly charged
by the pikemen and marines; while the few
who escaped, being cut down, fell over the ship&rsquo;s
side into the water, in attempting to regain their
own vessel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>The Euphrasia herself, having by this time
lost all her masts, and in other particulars sustained
much injury, the three ships ceased firing,
as if by general consent; the Turks making
every effort their crippled condition would permit,
to get clear of the English frigate.</p>

<p>Hostilities were now therefore suspended for
some hours, which hours were employed by our
hero, in causing all hands to work with such
unexampled diligence in making temporary
repairs, especially erecting jury masts, that, in
that short time, they had effected so much, as
to be again able to work the ship, and once
more to attack the enemy.</p>

<p>The two Turkish frigates lay at a little
distance, like logs on the face of the water;
unable to move from the relative situations into
which they had drifted during the cessation of
the battle, and too much separated to afford
each other any assistance. It was therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
with as much dismay as astonishment, that they
beheld the Euphrasia approach one of them,
take up a raking position within pistol shot of
her, and open a well-directed fire. This was
but feebly answered by the Turks, who, little
expecting a renewal of the combat before daylight,
were not prepared to fire more than one
or two of their stern chasers with any effect.
Stubborn, however, and desperate to the last,
they continued to fight with musketry, till their
decks were heaped with dead and dying; when,
their captain, losing all hope of escape, snatched
up a lighted match, and brandishing it in a
species of mad triumph, ran with it to fire the
magazine. At this point the frantic valour of this
remnant of a crew forsook them: they cut down
their captain ere he could effect his desperate purpose,
cried for quarter, and struck their colours.</p>

<p>Edmund now made sail towards the other
frigate. She had already lost the greater part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
of her crew, being the vessel which had boarded:
she could therefore make scarcely any resistance;
and, seeing the fate of her consort, she struck
her colours, after firing but one or two guns.</p>

<p>The object for which Edmund had been detached
being thus happily accomplished, he
rejoined Lord Fitz-Ullin as quickly as possible,
taking with him his two disabled prizes; both,
notwithstanding, valuable frigates. He was received,
as may well be imagined, with loud cheers
from the crews of all the vessels in the fleet.</p>

<p>Thus did our hero, in less than five years
from the date of his last visit to his friends at
Lodore, see himself, at the early age of four-and-twenty,
risen to the rank of post-captain,
possessed of prize-money to a large amount, and
crowned with laurels so gallantly won, as to render
his name known and respected in every part of the
world to which a newspaper could find its way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lord</span> Arandale, the eldest brother of Mrs.
Montgomery; his lady; their daughter, Lady
Susan Morven; their son, Lord Morven; and
a nephew, Colonel Morven, had all come from
Scotland, on a visit to their relative, and a tour
to the lakes.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montgomery, in compliment to these
friends, and also for the purpose of affording
some little society to her hitherto secluded
grand-daughters, had determined, though she
never would herself go out again, to see company
at home, as before the death of Lady L.
In pursuance of this plan, a large and gay<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
party was now assembled in the drawing-room
of Lodore House, awaiting the important summons
to that very dinner which we have just
seen Mrs. Smyth so anxiously preparing. There
was also to be a dance in the evening, to which
all the neighbouring families for many miles
round were invited.</p>

<p>Julia, now about eighteen, according to the
account given us in the last chapter by Mrs.
Smyth, was endeavouring, for the whim of the
thing, to learn from Lady Susan Morven, the
Scotch pronunciation of the words of &ldquo;Auld
Lang Syne,&rdquo; of which she was playing the accompaniment
on the harp; Mrs. Montgomery
and Lady Arandale were seated on a sofa, engaged
in conversation; Lord Arandale was
talking politics in a window with Mr. Jackson;
Frances, Lord Morven, and Colonel Morven,
were standing near the harp, laughing at Julia&rsquo;s
attempts at Scotch; and the rest, in various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
groupes, were exerting their patience, or their
wit, to pass away the time till dinner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is not right,&rdquo; said Lady Susan, &ldquo;can&rsquo;t
you say it as I do? We twa ha&rsquo;e climed aboot
the hills.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Julia recommenced accordingly; &ldquo;We twa
ha&rsquo;e climed&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash; The unfinished sentence died
away on her lips, her hands ceased to move on
the strings, she arose slowly from her seat,
stood some seconds motionless as a statue, her
colour mounting gradually, then darted past
Frances and the gentlemen. They turned to
look after her, and beheld her standing in the
centre of the room; her hand in that of an extremely
handsome young man, in a travelling
dress. The stranger appeared to be about four-and-twenty,
but was strikingly like the picture
of a lad, some three or four years younger,
which hung over the chimney-piece.</p>

<p>In short, it was Edmund. The fleet had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
returned to England; the Euphrasia wanted
repairs, that must require some months for their
completion; and our hero had availed himself
of the opportunity thus afforded him of visiting
Lodore House&mdash;setting out without even delaying
to write; and while the carriage in which
he had arrived, was driving round, he had entered
the drawing-room, according to his old
custom, from the lawn, by one of the open glass
doors. He had been dazzled by the unexpected
sight of a large company in rooms so long devoted
to mourning and quiet affections, while
the first distinct object which had fixed his
eyes, (guided possibly by certain sweet sounds,)
was the glittering pillar of a harp, the chords of
which, were vibrating at the moment in harmony
with the tones of a mellow, yet almost
infantine voice. A step more, and he beheld,
seated at the said harp &mdash;&mdash; impossible!&mdash;it
cannot be!&mdash;yet it must be, his darling little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
Julia that was, but transformed from the child
she had been when he last saw her, into a seeming
woman of perfect beauty, nay, almost majesty;
for Julia was not only tall of her age,
but as fully rounded as symmetry would permit.
She was dressed too, preparatory to the
ball of the evening, in a much too fashionable
full-dress (she had not yet arrived at choosing
for herself) sent from town by a fashionable
milliner, who wished to send also a long bill.</p>

<p>It was this artificial costume, in fact, though
Edmund was not aware of its power, which
had, at first sight, added years to Julia&rsquo;s apparent
age, and inspired our amazed hero with
absolute awe of his former playfellow. In the
crayon drawing he had of both sisters in one
frame, (full-length, age thirteen,) they wore
each a frock, without flounce or tucker, and
their fair hair loose on their shoulders.</p>

<p>While lost in astonishment, he gazed, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
saw in the well-remembered expression of the
soft hazel eyes, so often raised to his in the
undisguised fondness of childhood; but it was
indeed the same Julia; a vivid recollection of
their last meeting in that room, on that very
spot, and of the boat-cloak, in the folds of
which he had then, without hesitation, wrapped
his little favourite, as he clasped her to his
heart, presented itself most inopportunely, to
his imagination. Now the very retrospect
seemed presumption; yet the years that had
intervened, were to memory but as hours;
while the pressure of the soft hand, which kindly
returned that of his, did not at all tend to
the regulation of his already confused ideas.
Nor, indeed, had he any leisure whatever afforded
him for such an undertaking; for Frances,
as soon as she had turned and seen the
cause of Julia&rsquo;s emotion, had flown towards
him; and Mrs. Montgomery, on hearing Fran<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>ces&rsquo;
exclamation of&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, grandmamma, here&rsquo;s
Edmund!&rdquo; had called him to her; and Mr.
Jackson, on catching the same sounds, had left
Lord Arandale and his politics, and hastened to
greet his young friend. In short, he was surrounded
in a moment, and overwhelmed with
rejoicings, questionings, congratulations, and,
finally, introductions; being presented, in due
form, to Lord and Lady Arandale, and all the
family party.</p>

<p>The low growl of the gong, preceding its
fearful bellowings, was now heard; and Mrs.
Montgomery reminded our hero, that the ten
minutes it usually sounded was all the time
he would have to make his preparations for
dinner. He retired accordingly, and changed
his travelling dress for one more suitable to
the occasion.</p>

<p>On his return to the drawing-room, Julia was
still engaged playing Scotch airs, and learning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
the pronunciation of the words. Without being
conscious of the direction he gave his steps,
he went as directly towards her, as though he
had been the bearer of a message which he was
about to deliver. He stopped short, however,
when arrived within a pace or two of the harp,
where he remained standing. Julia continued
playing, but performed very badly; for she
was wishing to speak to Edmund in the kind
manner that every recollection of her habitual
feelings towards him dictated. She had never,
on any former occasion, found the least difficulty
in expressing those feelings. What an
awkward thing it is, she thought, to meet an
old friend, after a long absence, before so many
strangers!</p>

<p>She returned in a playful manner to the
song of &ldquo;Auld lang syne,&rdquo; for the sake of the
reference the words have to old times, and old
friends; but, when she looked up, very inno<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>cently,
intending, as a sort of friendly welcome,
to enforce the application by a kind smile, and
met the eyes of Edmund fixed upon her, she
looked down, blushed, felt an undefined uneasiness
as if she had done something wrong,
and did not venture to look up again; though
she said to herself, &ldquo;It is only Edmund!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edmund&rsquo;s gaze was so continued, that Mrs.
Montgomery asked him if Julia was much more
grown than he expected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am&mdash;oh, no!&rdquo; answered Edmund.
&ldquo;That is, I always thought&mdash;that Julia&mdash;but&mdash;but&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;
He coloured and stammered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always thought, myself, she would be
tall,&rdquo; said Mrs. Montgomery; &ldquo;but you think
her more grown than you could have supposed,
perhaps?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;ma&rsquo;am&mdash;yes&mdash;I do,&rdquo; he replied, glad
to be spared the task of translating himself.</p>

<p>Dinner was at this moment announced; and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
the next, Edmund heard the words:&mdash;&ldquo;Lady
Julia L., allow me&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; pronounced by Lord
Morven, who, at the same time, presented his
arm to Julia. She accepted it, and the couple
fell into the rear of the battalion, marching towards
the dining-room. Edmund felt an odd
sort of sensation, which he did not wait to define,
but, offering his arm to Frances, who was
busy, declaring that she wanted but half an
inch of Julia&rsquo;s height; he followed with her,
and, on taking his seat at the table, between
her ladyship and Lady Susan Morven, found
himself placed opposite to Julia and Lord
Morven.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a></h2>
<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">

<p>
&ldquo;Thou, fairer than the spirit of the hills,<br />
And blooming as the bow of the shower,<br />
With thy soft hair, floating round thy beauty<br />
Thus, like the bright curling mist of Cona,<br />
Hast thou no welcome for Fingall?&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> likeness between the twins had nearly
disappeared. The uncommon colour of the
hair, indeed, blended of flaxen and light brown,
with the luxuriance of its growth, and the peculiar
golden lustre received by the curls when
the light shone on them, was still the same in
both sisters. The fairness of the skin, too, was
much the same; but the rest will require separate
portraits.</p>

<p>Frances&rsquo; colour was not quite so brilliant as
her sister&rsquo;s; yet it was, at once, lively and delicate,
and came and went, in a slight degree, at
every movement. Her blue eyes sparkled, al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>most
continually, with unmixed delight. Her
mouth was small, pretty, and peculiarly flexible,
every moment escaping from any attempt at
gravity, into smiles and laughs of various degrees,
displaying the white, small, regular,
pearly teeth. Her figure was slight and light,
to a sylph-like degree, and so frequently seen
in the active pursuit of some medium of pleasure,
or means of mirth, that had her picture
been taken in any attitude that did not indicate
passing, that did not keep the beholder in constant
dread of its disappearance, it would not
have been like.</p>

<p>Julia&rsquo;s figure was perfectly formed, taller
than her sister&rsquo;s, and, as we have before observed,
as fully rounded as symmetry would
permit; her neck and shoulders particularly
fine. Her characteristic attitudes were those of
graceful quiescence; yet, when she did move,
it was with a freedom from effort, that preserved
unbroken that dignity of carriage, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
which, young as she was, she was already remarkable.
She had an air too of quiet composure,
equally beyond her years; though in
this Julia was, unintentionally, a hypocrite, her
seeming stillness of manner being the result of
a conscious depth of enthusiastic feeling, sedulously
concealed by extreme timidity, yet so
pre-occupying her entire nature, that trifles had
no power to excite, even in their due proportion.
Her colour, as well as Frances&rsquo;, came
and went, but seldomer, and on greater occasions;
and then its rising was more gradual, as
if a silent effort to avoid the exposure of emotion
had delayed, though it could not prevent,
the blush. Nay, from the moment it did dawn
on the cheek, it continued heightening, till it
arrived at a painful degree of intensity, and
then was as slow in retiring. Her mouth was
perfectly formed, the lips fuller than her sister&rsquo;s,
but only sufficiently so, to give an additional
luxuriance to her beauty; while her smile had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
a witchery about it, that no man whatever could
behold with entire composure. Her nose was
straight, her eyes hazel, their habitual expression
softness; but, when she listened to any
thing that interested her much, they assumed
an eagerness of look, so enthusiastic, so natural,
that it was at such moments her character was
best understood.</p>

<p>At the dinner table, around which we left
our party placing themselves, Edmund happened
to be, as we have already noticed, seated
facing Julia and Lord Morven. Thus situated,
our ill-starred hero felt a fatal desire to watch
the countenances and movements of his opposite
neighbours. He did so, as closely as politeness
would permit.</p>

<p>Lord Morven, in the course of conversation,
observed (aside) to his companion, that Captain
Montgomery was a very handsome fellow; and
then talked (but still in an under tone, to avoid
being heard by him who was the subject of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
remarks,) of how gallantly he, the said captain,
had behaved in his professional character; how
highly he was esteemed by Lord Fitz-Ullin, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A gradually spreading smile lit up every feature
of Julia&rsquo;s, as she listened.</p>

<p>Edmund, it may be remembered, had long
ago said, that he had always thought Julia&rsquo;s smile
the thing in all nature the most beautiful to
look on! He now thought so with more fervour
than ever, but with less pleasure; for he
now envied Lord Morven, each of whose supposed
soft whispers seemed to be welcomed by
the growing brightness of that smile, and by
the corresponding glow that grew with it on
the cheek, where sparkling dimples momentarily
came, and went, and came again. And
then, without distinctly determining why, he
suddenly began to think of the vast disparity
of birth, and consequent place in society, between
himself and Julia; while some busy fiends
seemed to press on his notice the exact suitabi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>lity
of Lord Morven&rsquo;s rank and circumstances,
in every particular.</p>

<p>Julia made some observation to his lordship.</p>

<p>Edmund&rsquo;s eyes rested on the motions of her
lips while she spoke; and (strange flight of
fancy!) he, at this critical moment, called to
mind an ancient family legend, which asserted,
that eighteen years since he had actually kissed
those lips&mdash;those very lips! Eighteen years!
nay, five years since, could he not himself perfectly
remember having, as a matter of course,
on his arrival, kissed little Julia most affectionately;
while those white arms, which now
dazzled his sight across the table, had hung
around his neck. He wondered if she remembered
it, and what she thought about it, if she
did. He supposed such a salutation would now
be considered very strange&mdash;indeed quite improper,
quite impertinent, even had they not
met before so large a company. He wondered
too, how little consequence he had attached to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
the circumstance at the time, though he had
always idolized her as a child, from the enthusiastic
fondness she had always shown for him.
Did any of that feeling still exist? How well
he could remember her insisting on sitting close
beside him, with a hand of his in both of hers,
and her full eyes raised to his, to watch his
every look. Unlucky recollections! for, in efforts
of the imagination to identify the Julia so
remembered, with the Julia now before him,
he nearly lost his dinner. He rejected and accepted,
in the same breath, whatever was offered
him; allowed the plates that had each, for a
limited time, stood before him in due succession,
to go away almost untouched; and when
rallied by Lord Arandale on his want of appetite,
and asked whether he had left his heart
with some foreign fair one, or eat luncheon, he
replied, that he had made an excellent dinner.
When, however, convicted of having scarcely
tasted any thing, by the united testimony both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
of Frances and Lady Susan, who had hitherto
only suppressed their laughter, for fear of
awaking him from his reverie, he changed his
ground of defence, said he was too much fatigued
to eat, and called for wine and water.</p>

<p>Mrs. Montgomery feared he was ill. He declared
he was perfectly well, and helped himself
largely from a fluted shape of jelly just set
down before him; the elegant form of which he
thus cruelly defaced, without the slightest consideration
for all the anxiety it had cost good
Mrs. Smyth.</p>

<p>On the gentlemen repairing to the drawing-room,
Edmund, who entered the apartment immediately
after Lord Morven, saw his lordship
go forward and take up a lover-like position,
leaning on the back of Julia&rsquo;s chair. Frances
and Lady Susan were at the pianoforte, singing
a duet. Our hero, who thought that under the
circumstances he must not approach Julia, as,
after his so recent return, had else been natural,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
possessed himself of a sort of neutral ground
between the parties, where he stood listening
to, or intending to listen to, the music. His
attention, however, was much disturbed by observing
the confidential manner of Julia and
Lord Morven, and the interest with which they
seemed to converse. He had certainly no intention
of becoming a listener; nor, for some
time, did a single word alarm his sense of
honour by reaching his sense of hearing.</p>

<p>At length, during a diminuendo passage in
the singing, he distinctly heard Lord Morven
say,</p>

<p>&ldquo;We can spend a couple of years abroad while
the building of our new house is completing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Julia&rsquo;s sweet voice reply, with perfect
complacency,</p>

<p>&ldquo;That will be rather agreeable than otherwise.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edmund&rsquo;s heart beat to such an excess that
he could scarcely breathe; but he resolutely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
moved to a greater distance: the duet, too,
having just concluded, the final symphony began
to thunder away, drowning all other sounds, so
that, for the present, he heard no more.</p>

<p>When the music had ended, however, Frances
sent him (for by that time he was standing by
the pianoforte) to request that Julia would
sing. He went towards her accordingly; but
before he could draw her attention, her head
being turned back over her shoulder speaking to
Lord Morven, he was in a manner compelled to
hear her say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Remember, the promise I have given is only
conditional; my father&rsquo;s consent, of course,
must be obtained, before I can be considered to
have formed an engagement of so serious a nature.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edmund, confounded, uncertain whether he
ought to retreat or speak immediately, stammered
out her name. She looked round with a
sort of start, and blushed. He hastened to re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>lieve
her embarrassment by delivering his message;
but so confused were his own ideas, that
he could scarcely find words in which to make
himself understood. When at length he succeeded
in doing so, Julia declined singing: her
alleged reason was, that dancing, she believed,
was about to commence. Music, at the same
time, striking up in an adjoining apartment, the
company, in general, directed their steps towards
the inspiring sounds.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She is going to marry him!&rdquo; thought Edmund,
as he moved unconsciously in the same
direction with those around him.</p>

<p>He next began to think, would there be any
use in asking Julia to dance, and to fear that, of
course, Lord Morven had already done so, when
he heard a stranger behind him say:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose Lady Julia L. will commence
the dancing with Lord Borrowdale;&rdquo; and at
the same moment he saw a young man of
very fashionable appearance go towards Julia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
and lead her to the head of the room. He
turned towards Frances, whom next to Julia
he loved; but, just as he reached her, she took
the arm of Lord Morven, and moved on. Edmund
now gave up all thoughts of dancing,
and stood with his arms folded, watching every
movement of Julia&rsquo;s. His thoughts adverted,
with strong emotion, to his boyish days, when
he had ever found Lodore House in quiet seclusion;
when his return thither seemed to be considered
as an event; when neither of his little
sisters, as he called them then, seemed to have a
thought, a wish, an amusement, or a happiness,
that was not found in his society. But the
scene was changed; his play-fellows were become
women, were surrounded by men of their
own rank in life; while the affection, which he
had hitherto freely declared for them, and
which he, who had no other friends, still fondly
felt for them, now seemed, even to himself, a
sort of presumption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>

<p>The sisters, with their respective partners,
stood opposite couples. Lord Borrowdale took
Julia&rsquo;s hand, and, leading her forward, left her
beside Lord Morven, and returned to his place.
Lord Morven took her hand: Edmund thought
lords very disagreeable sort of people. Lord
Morven proceeded to lead both sisters forward,
then all three fell back to the position they had
left: and Lord Borrowdale, coming forward
alone, figured before them, laughing and talking
carelessly; then joining all hands round, led
Julia back to her place, (Edmund thought,)
with an air of triumph that seemed to say, &ldquo;this
is my share;&rdquo; at the same time, his lordship,
stooping towards her and whispering something,
she looked up and smiled as she replied. Edmund
thought Lord Borrowdale an insolent,
conceited-looking puppy. Lord Morven then
led Frances forward, and, while leaving her on
the further hand of Lord Borrowdale, bent
across and said something to Julia: she an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>swered
with another smile, and Edmund came
to the sage conclusion that exalted rank and
sounding titles were quite indispensable to happiness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;While I,&rdquo; he mentally continued, &ldquo;have
not even a name, but a borrowed one, for the use
of which I am indebted to the compassionate
kindness of her grandmother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Julia, at this moment, looked towards Edmund,
and perceiving that he seemed grave and
was not dancing, she smiled, and made a signal
with her fan for him to approach. He was at
her elbow in a moment, his heart beating, and
his hatred to lords considerably diminished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you not dancing, Edmund?&rdquo;
asked Julia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You were engaged,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and so
was Frances; and I, you know, have been
scarcely ashore since I was a boy, and am, therefore,
quite a stranger. But&mdash;the next dance&mdash;perhaps&mdash;you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;I have just
promised Lord Morven to dance with him:
and Frances too, I know, is engaged to Lord
Borrowdale.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The deuce take those lords!&rdquo; thought Edmund.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately for me, certainly!&rdquo; he replied
aloud; the smile, with which Julia&rsquo;s summons
had lit up his features, fading quite away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But Lady Susan,&rdquo; continued Julia, &ldquo;perhaps
she is not engaged: or, if she is, grandmamma,
I am sure, can get you a partner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You, then, are engaged for the whole evening,
I suppose?&rdquo; said Edmund.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no! only for the next set.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, will you dance the one after with me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Certainly! and Frances the one after that.
But I am so sorry,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;that you
have not been dancing all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this instant, Lord Borrowdale snatched up
her hand, as the music indicated the moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
and led her forward again to perform some new
evolution of the dance. When the music ceased,
Julia said something to Lady Susan: and, on
receiving her reply and smile, looked towards
Edmund, and telegraphed the smile with the
yes it implied. Our hero was accustomed in
his own profession to understanding and obeying
signals; he, therefore, stepped forward, requested
the honour of Lady Susan&rsquo;s hand for
the next set, and received a ready assent.</p>

<p>The music now commenced a waltz tune,
and Lord Morven immediately began to wheel
himself round and round, and holding up his
arms in a circular position, to approach Julia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just one round of the room!&rdquo; he cried;
&ldquo;pray do!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edmund&rsquo;s heart stopped beating to await her
reply, while one foot was unconsciously advanced
at the moment, as if to avert the
apprehended catastrophe. Julia laughed at
the many entreating attitudes Lord Morven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
thought fit to assume, but shook her head, and
answered, &ldquo;No! no!&rdquo; on which his lordship
seized his sister, Lady Susan, in his arms, and
whirled her round and round the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would, I fear,&rdquo; said Lord Borrowdale,
addressing our heroine, with affected humility,
&ldquo;be too great presumption in me, after Morven&rsquo;s
discomfiture, to think of changing your
ladyship&rsquo;s determination?&rdquo; Julia declined.
&ldquo;Morven,&rdquo; proceeded his lordship, &ldquo;certainly
has no right to esteem himself quite irresistible,
notwithstanding the present favourable juncture
of his stars. In a day or two, at farthest,
this gay monopolizer of all that is brightest
and loveliest, must, I understand, withdraw
from Cupid&rsquo;s lists, and confess himself a mere
married man!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Edmund, though he heard not a word of
what Frances was very kindly saying to him
about not having danced, yet heard every word
of Lord Borrowdale&rsquo;s speech. All the blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
in his system seemed to rush to his face, it
suffused even his forehead, and mounted to the
very roots of his hair. &ldquo;In a day or two! In
a day or two!&rdquo; he repeated to himself. &ldquo;So
public, so ascertained a thing, that other men
think themselves at liberty to speak to her on
the subject in this free and careless manner!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lady Susan, whirling over at the moment,
almost fell against Edmund&rsquo;s arm, on which,
laughing at the reeling of her head, she rested
a finger to steady herself. Her ladyship was
all fair, all soft, and without much form; but,
being young, she was by no means forbidding;
and her countenance exhibited such a ceaseless
sunshine of smiles, and was so much adorned
by the undulating movement of its dimples,
now deepening, now spreading on rosy cheeks,
or playing around ruby lips, that the beholder
had no leisure to observe its dumpling contour,
or criticise its want of feature.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How fond my brother is of being a beau!&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
observed Lady Susan to her partner, as Julia
and Lord Morven took their places opposite.</p>

<p>&ldquo;His lordship must resign that character
shortly, I understand,&rdquo; said Edmund, with effort.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a day or two, I suppose,&rdquo; replied her
ladyship. &ldquo;You have observed, I dare say,
what an admirer he is of his cousin, Lady Julia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is very apparent, certainly,&rdquo; replied Edmund.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; exclaimed her ladyship, &ldquo;so I
tell him! I don&rsquo;t know what his wife will say
to all this, when she comes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His wife!&rdquo; exclaimed Edmund, unable to
trust his ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She has no right to complain, to be sure!&rdquo;
continued Lady Susan, &ldquo;for she is an unconscionable
flirt herself!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;His wife!&rdquo; again reiterated Edmund.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, his wife,&rdquo; she repeated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So, then, Lord Morven is a married man!&rdquo;
said Edmund.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any thing so very astonishing in
that?&rdquo; demanded her ladyship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;oh no,&rdquo; he stammered out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lady Morven is expected here in a few
days,&mdash;that is, if she does not disappoint, as
usual,&rdquo; continued Lady Susan.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In a few days!&rdquo; repeated Edmund.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you then think my brother so very
disagreeable, or ugly, or what, that he could
not get a wife?&rdquo; she asked, laughing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ugly! disagreeable!&rdquo; repeated Edmund,
glancing a complacent look at Lord Morven,
(for his own good-humour was fast returning,)
&ldquo;quite the contrary; your brother is extremely
handsome!&rdquo; and he might have added, &ldquo;so is
your ladyship,&rdquo; had he spoken all he thought:
for Lady Susan&rsquo;s smiling countenance, just
then, appeared the most charming in the world,
Julia&rsquo;s only excepted, at which, from an involuntary
impulse, he at the instant stole a glance.
He met her eyes&mdash;she smiled&mdash;a kind of in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>toxication
came over his spirits&mdash;he danced as
if on air, and talked an immensity. His partner
thought him quite fascinating. When the
dance was over, Frances and several other
ladies congratulated Lady Susan, with much
laughing, on her sudden conquest, telling her
she had already made quite another being of
Captain Montgomery! Frances said she should
resign any claims she might have on the score
of old acquaintanceship, for she thought Edmund
quite spoiled, he was grown so affected.</p>

<p>He, for his part, had flown to avail himself
of Julia&rsquo;s promise. He had forgotten disparity
of rank, want of fortune, mystery of
birth, everything, but that she was not going
to be married to Lord Morven! He could
now feel only, that he was near to, dancing
with, looking upon a being altogether captivating;
and experiencing, in so doing, a delight
he had never known before; while blending
itself with, and lending an additional in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>terest
to, the natural admiration of personal
loveliness, there was, as he gazed, an unexamined,
yet endearing consciousness, that this
was indeed the self-same being, not only whom
he had all his life tenderly loved, but, still
more, who had always shown the strongest, the
most enthusiastic affection for him. It was as
a child, certainly&mdash;but it was delightful to remember
it! And as she sat at the supper-table,
trying with now downcast, now averted
eyes, to laugh off the blushes which Edmund&rsquo;s
extravagant compliments on her growth and
improvement had called up; and that he, turning
towards her, his arm leaning on the table
before her, forgetting all present but herself,
the moments flew in a delirium of absolute
happiness, till all but the thus engrossed couple
having risen from their seats, they too were
reminded that it was time to move: and the
gay scene closed for the night.</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The bright vision lasted not.&rdquo;<br />
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Edmund retired to rest, all his ideas
were in such a state of confusion, that sleep was
absolutely out of the question. He found it
equally impossible to arrange his thoughts.
All came and went in a constant whirl, over
which he seemed to have no controul. Yet, at
first, all were blissful: fond recollections again
and again presented themselves, of the endearing
attachment which Julia had in childhood
evinced for him; and these again and again
blended themselves with intoxicating visions of
her present loveliness, and while the tenderness
he had ever cherished for her, was all at once
converted into an overwhelming passion; so
entirely was every reasoning faculty subdued,
that with no better foundation than these same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
recollections, a delightful feeling, almost approaching
a sense of mutual affection, glowed at
his heart, and unconsciously strengthened his
own infatuation.</p>

<p>When it so happens, that the same object
which has engrossed the tenderest affections of
the child; and which, if we may be allowed the
expression, is, as it were, at home in the heart,
associated with all its best, its purest feelings,
becomes also the first object to awaken passion,
the feeling, so produced, is as rare as the combination
of circumstances out of which it arises.
This is <i>First Love</i>, indeed, with all its own
luxuriance of blossom, yet as deep-rooted as
the ties of kindred: how unlike the surface-sown
plant, <i>Love at First Sight</i>.</p>

<p>As, however, the delightful sensations derived
from seeing and speaking to Julia, from receiving
her smiles, and listening to the sweet accents
of her voice; as these, we say, began to subside,
other, and less pleasing thoughts, like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
spectres, arose and crossed his imagination: at
first singly, and at a great distance, and causing
only momentary panics; afterwards, nearer and
nearer; till, at length, they collected around
him, closed in upon him, awoke him from his
dream of unfounded, unjustifiable happiness,
and compelled him to look on the realities of
his situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Though,&rdquo; said he to himself, &ldquo;she is not
to be, thank heaven!&mdash;cannot be married to
Lord Morven, I am not the less altogether unworthy
of her! It would not be the less of
presumption, the less of ingratitude, the less of
baseness in me, to indulge for a moment in such
a thought. Though Lord Morven happens to
be a married man, it is to some one of rank and
fortune equal to his, that Lord L. will think of
uniting his daughter. That Lord Borrowdale!&mdash;he
is not married, and it was with him she
danced the first set&mdash;and they are neighbours
too. But of what avail is it for me to torture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
myself with conjectures?&mdash;it is enough for me,
that she can never, never&mdash;no, never be&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
He paused&mdash;then recommenced&mdash;&ldquo;I must fly
her presence! I must return to the wild waves
which have long been my home, and make them
my home still! There I have earned a sort of
claim; elsewhere I have none! On no one
spot of earth can the wretched Edmund place
the wanderer&rsquo;s foot, and say, &lsquo;This is my native
soil!&rsquo;&mdash;and for a name&mdash;&mdash;!&rdquo; Here the painful
thought pressed upon him, that he had no
actual right to any. He then remembered, with
a sigh, the many useless efforts which had been
made to discover his birth. Then a burning
blush tingled on his cheek, as the sudden thought
struck him, and for the first time, that he might
possibly be the child of shame, and that therefore
it was that no one would claim him. He
strove to shake off the idea; then, as if to
drown an intruding voice, which seemed to
whisper that the suggestion was probable, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
thus continued:&mdash;&ldquo;Wrapped in mystery, as
every thing concerning me is, I must, all my
life, remain an isolated, a miserable being!
A home of joy&mdash;sweet domestic affections&mdash;all,
in short, that renders life desirable, is forbidden
to me! Under what name dare I present myself
before heaven&rsquo;s holy altar? What appellation
dare I offer to that woman who would
share my fortunes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Engaged in reflections such as these, every
delightful vision vanished, the tumultuous beatings
of each pulse subsided; and, under the
sobering, yet soporific influence of sadness, he
at length fell asleep&mdash;a long and tremulous sigh,
as his eye-lids closed, breaking, for the last
time, the regulated breathing which nature was
endeavouring to establish. His dreams, however,
by an extraordinary contradiction, took
their colour from his first feelings. Julia
seemed to be before him; to smile sweetly upon
him; to raise her full eyes to his. Their ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>pression
carried absolute conviction to his heart
that he was beloved: the impression was irresistible:
he thought he declared his own mad
passion; he thought he saw her covered with
blushes indeed, but there was no reproof in her
manner, and all his own scruples, too, had
somehow vanished! He thought he held her
soft hand; (for he remembered, particularly
when he awoke, how soft it had felt;) she did
not withdraw it; nay, it seemed to return the
pressure of his! Then he thought, with all the
strange and sudden inconsistency of dreams,
that he had actually been married to Julia for
some time, though he could not remember how
or where the ceremony had taken place; yet
he saw her so distinctly that he was sure
he was awake. Her appearance was what it
had been the evening before at the supper
table; but her manners, what they had used to
be in childhood: the same endearing, enthusiastic,
unreserved affection; manifesting itself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
with all the happy confidence of mutual and
habitual fondness.</p>

<p>But the feelings such visions excited were
not calm enough for undisturbed repose: he
heard the beating of his own heart, through his
sleep; he began to fear he was dreaming; he
tried not to awake&mdash;but it would not do: his
eyes opened; he saw the sun shining through
his window-curtains; he started upright in his
bed. A tide of contradictory recollections
poured in upon him; but, alas! where were
those so full of bliss?&mdash;They were in his dream!&mdash;they
were not to be recalled; yet, while he
could contrive to discourage all thought, a
vaguely pleasing impression remained, as though
something very delightful had lately happened!
He dressed mechanically; when, crossing his
apartment to step forth by a glass door, which
opened on the lawn, he caught a glimpse of
Julia, turning into one of the walks of the
shrubbery. His heart began again to beat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
audibly, as it had done in his dream; he stumbled
against his valet, who stood offering him
his hat, and, going out without it, flew across
the green to join her. She, too, had had her
reflections: she had reproached herself for having
treated Edmund quite like a stranger.
&ldquo;And without any fault of his,&rdquo; said she to
herself&mdash;for Julia was a great respecter of
justice, and, on the present occasion, fancied
herself guided entirely by its dictates. There
was not one hour of her whole existence, (that
she could remember,) when Edmund had not
shared with Frances her sisterly affection; and
he had not done any thing wrong, she argued
with herself&mdash;any thing unkind, any thing to
forfeit any one&rsquo;s regard; then would it not be
very wrong, very unjust of her, if she did not
still love&mdash;that is to say, still consider him as
her brother. Had not grandmamma and Mr.
Jackson always loved him as much as if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
was really so; and, of course, they did so
still, and so ought Frances and herself.</p>

<p>Had she been aware how very complimentary
to Edmund were the causes which had unconsciously
operated upon her manner, in producing
the unusual restraint of which she was
so painfully conscious, she would have acquitted
herself of unkindness to an old friend, and want
of generous feeling towards the friendless; for
we can venture to assert, upon our own knowledge
of her warm-hearted character, that had
Edmund not been tall or handsome; had his
figure and carriage had no air, no look of consequence,
no dignity, no grace; had there been
no expression in his eyes, particularly when he
looked at her; no glow on his cheek, especially
when he spoke to her; nothing at all dangerous
in his smile, or persuasive in the tones of his
voice, particularly when he spoke to her; had
she never heard his gallant actions and high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
character extolled; had she never known Mr.
Jackson, as he laid down the newspaper, exclaim,
&ldquo;There is true nobility for you! Pray
what is it that you titled people inherit from
your ancestors, but the distant reflection of
some great exploit performed by some one of
them, for which he was ennobled! Then, is
not that man, in whom the splendour of noble
deeds is self-existent, in whom it shines independent
of reflection, greater than any of you?
And yet,&rdquo; would he add, with that glaring inconsistency
of which the wisest of us are often
guilty, &ldquo;I have not a doubt that my Edmund,
my boy, will yet prove the descendant of a line
of ancestry as exalted as his own merits, and I
need say no more!&rdquo; Had nothing, we say, of
all this been the case; on the contrary, had all
this been reversed&mdash;had Edmund been, as indeed
he might have been, and yet have been a
very worthy personage, a little, insignificant-looking,
diminutive-faced, bandy-legged fellow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
with a grey freckled skin, light red hair, and
green-gooseberry eyes, who had never done any
thing remarkable in his life, of whom nobody
spoke, whose entrance into a room created no
sensation,&mdash;in this case, we maintain that Julia
would have felt, forcibly, his situation as the
protegé of her family; that she would have
dreaded the thoughts of his feeling himself
little among so many great people; and that,
therefore, she would have shown him, particularly
on his return home, the most marked attention,
and bestowed, too, with the utmost
frankness.</p>

<p>This morning, however, she had not yet seen
him, to remind her of the tall and awful hero
he now appeared in her eyes; and she had been
studiously bringing to her recollection what he
had been, when Frances and herself used to vie
with each other in declarations of how much
they loved him, and ask him, again and again,
which he loved best; and she well remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
(but, of course, as the nonsense of children)
that he used to tell her, when Frances would
get tired of the subject, and run away to play,
that it was her he loved best; that she was his
favourite, his darling Julia! &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Finally, she came to the valiant resolve, to
shake off the artificial manner, made up of too
much, perhaps sometimes, and, certainly, often
too little courtesy, which she felt she had had
a part, at least, of yesterday, and to be, what
she had ever been, towards one, who had no
friends but those at Lodore House. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
mean,&rdquo; said she to herself, &ldquo;flying into his
arms at meetings and partings, as I used to do,
when I was a foolish child;&rdquo; and here she
blushed, and felt astounded, at the recollection;
&ldquo;but I mean to show him frank and unaffected
kindness, always the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As she arrived at this sage conclusion, Edmund
stood before her, looking not the worse
for the want of his hat, the careless arrange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>ment
the breeze had thought fit to make of his
hair, and the heightened colour caused by running;
to say nothing of a certain beaming
light, which thoughts, that lovers&rsquo; lips dare not
confess, sometimes shed through lovers&rsquo; eyes.
In short, his dream had given a most dangerous,
delighted, bridegroom-like expression to
his countenance!</p>

<p>On first seeing him Julia blushed, as though,
in her late conference with herself, she had been
speaking, instead of only thinking, and might
have been overheard. In pursuance, however,
of her resolve, she extended towards him the
open palm of welcome, as she bade him good
morning.</p>

<p>When he felt her hand within his, soft as
it had been in his dream; when he saw her
cheek glowing, and in her eyes, as she lifted
them to his, beheld the blended expression of
kindness and timidity, called up by the yet
unsubdued current of such reflexions as had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
just passed through her mind; he could not
help thinking how like she, at that moment,
looked, to what she had appeared in the too
delightful vision, from which he had so lately
and so unwillingly awakened.</p>

<p>He was so much absorbed by this idea, that
his eyes dwelt on her face, till hers were bent
on the ground: her blush, too, deepened. She
wished to speak, but felt there was something
in his manner, which made it impossible for
her to keep her resolution of behaving with
perfect ease; both remained silent, and she
withdrew her hand.</p>

<p>Edmund, who had continued gazing, till
aroused by this movement, now felt that some
apology was necessary. He stammered out one
about her being so much grown, and about
trying to trace, in her present appearance, the
little favourite of his boyish days. &ldquo;After the
first surprise is over,&rdquo; he added, encouraged by
a gentle look, and playfully lowering his tone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
and smiling, as he drew her hand over his arm,
and walked slowly on, his head turned towards
his companion&mdash;&ldquo;after the first surprise is over,
of finding her, whom I can remember carrying
about in my arms through these very woods,
become,&mdash;while I was so busy ploughing the
wide ocean, that I observed not the lapse of
time,&mdash;a full-grown, fashionable, awe-inspiring
woman!&mdash;when this surprise is over, I say,
you will find that I shall learn to behave myself
with all due propriety, and not stare grownup
young ladies out of countenance, as if they
were still children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Julia, remembering her resolution, seized
this opening, and said, &ldquo;I hope, Edmund,
I shall never prove so much the woman of
fashion, as to be capricious or unsisterly, in my
manners or conduct. Perhaps you think I have
been so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You quite mistake my meaning, Julia,&rdquo;
said Edmund.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo;&mdash;she continued, hesitating, &ldquo;I trust
you will find that the regard which Frances
and I have felt for you, from our earliest childhood,
will prove, through life, an unshaken
friendship!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was valiantly said of Julia; and the
speech took all the breath, of which she was
mistress, to bring it to so handsome a conclusion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If your friendship,&rdquo; he replied, with
sudden depression of manner, &ldquo;and that of
your family were withdrawn, what would be
left to the desolate Edmund!&rdquo; A short
silence ensued. &ldquo;Promise me, Julia,&rdquo; he recommenced,
taking again the hand that leaned
on his arm, and trembling as he reflected that
he might yet lose all share in her regard, if
his rash passion should ever be discovered;
&ldquo;promise me, that you never will, under
any circumstances, withdraw your friendship
from me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span></p>
<p>Julia, after hesitating a little, said&mdash;&ldquo;I
may, I think, make that promise, Edmund,
for I am sure you never will deserve
to lose it, and&mdash;even&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped
as if uncertain whether or not she ought
to proceed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do not check that kind sentence, Julia!&rdquo;
he exclaimed, in a tone of entreaty. &ldquo;You
were going to say, that you would still
regard and pity the unfortunate Edmund,
even if he were in fault, and condemned by
strangers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I am sure I would, Edmund,&rdquo; she
replied, after a moment&rsquo;s pause; &ldquo;and so would
Frances, and so would grandmamma,&rdquo; she added,
eagerly, as Edmund pressed the hand which
leaned on his arm against his heart, to express
his gratitude.</p>

<p>At this moment, Henry, who had been sent
to call them in to breakfast, came up. He
curled his lip as he observed Edmund let go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
the hand of Julia, and all three walked towards
the house in silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do, Captain Montgomery,&rdquo;
whispered Henry, as they entered, affecting a
laugh.</p>

<p>Edmund reddened, and turning on him with
a frown, said, &ldquo;I request, sir, that you will
spare yourself the trouble of thinking for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Julia was a few steps in advance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the quarter-deck, sir,&rdquo; said Henry,
with mock deference, &ldquo;I bow to your opinions;
but here, I too must request the liberty of
thinking for myself, as well as feeling solicitude
for a lady, towards whom I stand somewhat,
though not absolutely, I am happy to say, in
the situation of a brother, being one of her
nearest male relatives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sir!&rdquo; said Edmund, &ldquo;till I request your
confidence on the subject of your solicitudes, I
beg I may not be troubled with the recital of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>
<p>This short scene passed while the various
morning salutations which Julia&rsquo;s appearance
had called forth were going round the breakfast-table,
and, consequently, entirely escaped
her notice. Lord Borrowdale, starting up, on
her first entrance, had given her his seat, and
found, or rather made room for himself beside
her.</p>

<p>Lady Susan, whom Frances had laughed
into a belief that she had achieved a first-sight
conquest of Captain Montgomery, now made
room for Edmund near herself, and all the time
of breakfast, simpered, dimpled, laughed, and
talked to him, while he thought only of how he
could, with most propriety, resent the insolence
of Henry. Lord Borrowdale composed and
delivered elaborate compliments to Julia on the
roses she had collected during her morning
ramble, directing, from time to time, rather inquisitive,
and not very well-satisfied glances,
towards the much too handsome companion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
her walk. Lord Morven mentioned to Mrs.
Montgomery how much he wished Julia and
Frances to accompany Lady Morven and himself
in the Italian trip they proposed making,
while their new house was finishing; and added,
that Julia had half-promised him, in case Lord
L. gave his consent. Mrs. Montgomery shook
her head, and Edmund almost smiled to think
how much unnecessary misery this subject had
caused him only the evening before.</p>

<p>The smile, however, was but languid, for of
what avail was it that this source of uneasiness
was removed; was not Lord Borrowdale&rsquo;s
admiration declared? and was it not probable
that he would be approved of by all her
friends? Or, if Lord Borrowdale were not in
existence, he himself, at least, had no pretentions&mdash;worse
than none! he was peculiarly
bound by honour, gratitude, every good feeling,
not even to stand the competition, had
he the egregious vanity to hope that such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
treachery could avail him. Henry&rsquo;s interference,
indeed, he despised as much as he
resented; and had he been capable of doing
wrong, from a feeling of false pride, he would,
from that moment, have paid Julia pointed
attention; but his own sense of right was too
strong to permit such a line of conduct. The
impulse, indeed, was felt, but instantly rejected;
for now that reason, which his dream for a
time had banished, was restored, by seeing Julia
join the circle of the proud, the gay, the titled,
(which was surely her natural sphere,) honour
and duty predominated even over passion. He
still, however, resented the liberty Henry had
taken, and immediately after breakfast sought
an interview with him, which ended in that
gentleman finding himself compelled to make an
ample apology, though with a very bad grace.</p>
